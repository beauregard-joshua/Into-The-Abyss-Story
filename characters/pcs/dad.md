## Personality
Dad's personality is agressive and blunt. He is not very intelligent, so he often immedietely says what comes to his mind, which is often not the most eloquent phrase. As an example, Dad once intimidated one of his party members on watch to ask if he had killed somone, actually holding him in the air to get his answer. There have been several instances in which Dad went for aggression rather than diplomacy.

Although his demeanor is tough, Dad is actually a person that strives for good. He seems somewhat resourceful and uses everything he has to his advantage. Throughout his time in the Underdark he has given his support for finding food and supplies, as well as fighting off some dangerous foes. In fact, combining his lack of intelligence, Dad has been a part of encouraging mistakes while thinking he was doing good work. For example, when [Ebadius](ebadius.md) started combat with some duergar traders, Dad assumed that they had threatened Ebadius and jumped into the fray.

While not intelligence, Dad is surprisingly wise and capable. While some party members such as [Alias](alias.md) try to manipulate and smooth talk him, Dad is well aware what is happening and simply lets this behavior boost his ego.

## Background
Little is known about Dad and his background. He is surprisingly wise for an orc and makes a lot of "dad" jokes, leading to the possibility that he is actually a father and has a family somewhere.

## Story
### [The Prison at Velkenvelve](../../sessions/arc01/info.md)
Dad arrived at Velkenvelve in the second wave of prisoners, together with Alias and [Buppido](../party/buppido.md) and after the group of Ebadius, [Groggle](groggle.md), and Sarith. He immedietely was uncomfortable, not knowing who the others were and also not knowing what races everyone appeared to be. His suggestions for escape all tended to involve fighting, although not many other prisoners were up for these ideas.

Dad, Ebadius, and Buppido were simultaneously assigned to cleaning duty in the mess hall when Dad tried to steal a knife. He was caught by the drow and a fight broke out. Dad backflipped several times and struck the drow, injuring them, but was eventually injured so much by [Ilvara](../velkenvelve/ilvara.md) that he was unable to continue fighting. While be escorted by the drow back to the jail cell Dad threw himself and his captor over the ledge into the lower spiderwebs. There her tried to escape to safety, fighting alongside Groggle and Alias, before he was eventually overcome and taken back to the cell.

Dad quickly befriended a new prisoner Ront, an orc from the surface. Together they tried to form a means of escape, but the drow gave them minimal tools and split them up, making it difficult to amount an escape.

Dad, Sarith, and another prisoner Eldeth were given a rock stacking chore when Sarith suddenly attacked a guardsman. Dad rallied Eldeth to fight and together they made it to the elevator after throwing two quaggoth over the edge. Dad also encouraged Ront and [Derendil](../party/derendil.md) to fight the guard when several demons swooped in and caused more of a commotion. He brought his companions to safety and returned to grab the others. In the end Dad saved himself, Eldeth, Ront, Ebadius, Alias, Buppido, and [Stool](../party/stool.md) and met up with the others that had escaped.

When it came to leaving Velkevelve, Dad was vocal about traveling with Stool and Sarith to Neverlight Grove, but was outvoted as the partty voted for Sloobludop

### [Travel to Sloobludop](../../sessions/arc02/info.md)
Dad acted as one of the frontline warriors in the traveling party, due to his strength and constitution. His sanity began to waver as the party approach the lost city of Alversin. The whispers and scampering sounds eventually caused Dad to lose his mind briefly, but Alias calmed him down and he was able to proceed.

In Alversin, Dad searched a few streets together with Ront, Stool, and Shuushar. After Shuushar ran away screaming, Dad and Ront invstigated to find an octopus (dubbed the *rocktopus*) within the city, and Dad used his newfound axe to kill the octopus with Ront. Together they cut the meat of the octopus for travel.

When the party was awoken by the drow search party, Dad quickly stopped Ront from maing any noise, as he was prone to doing.

After Edleth found [Jimjar](../party/jimjar.md) dead, Dad suspected both Sarith and Buppido. During his watch with Sarith, Dad intimidated Sarith, causing him to get defensive, and after Dad threatened him and woke everyone up, the party began to suspect that Dad had something to do with Jimjar's death. He continued to suspect Sarith and Buppido but said nothing else of it.

Dad stayed mostly behind when fighting the fungus in the fungus caverns, mostly following along with the others. While he mostly kept quiet during their travels, when Dad did speak it was often in great agression toward Sarith, who he still believed was acting suspicously. When a small group left to investigate for a safe place to stay, Dad continued to rile Sarith up and then told the others that Sarith confessed to killing Jimjar, which was a lie.

Dad remained mostly quiet on the rest of the trip to Sloobludop. He convinced Ront that eating Stool was a bad idea during a watch when food was running low. When attacked by a grell Dad was one of the first to strike and was the one to kill it. He also helped cut it up for food for the day, which Dad called the food "grell brains" because of what he thought a grell looked like. During their food shortages, Dad never went hungry.

When the party enocuntered a rogue group of kuo-tao, Dad was interested in fighting them, but the party went more with diplomacy. When Plooploopeen asked for assistance, Dad offered his help. When they made their way to Sloobludop, Dad made sure to bathe in the darklake nude for all to see.

During his time in Sloobludop, Dad did street performances with feats of acrobatics for money. He also performed his acrobatics when the party settled for the evening and helped keep people entertained for some time, along with Groggle's "ham-bonin'". He was actually the inspiration for Eldeth to join in the festivities and try a backflip herself, although it did not work out.

While infiltrating the cult of the Deep Father, Dad attacked the kuo-tao meant to sacrifice everyone after he had attacked Eldeth, but Dr. Lobotomy shattered on impact with the kuo-toa's spear. Dad continued to use the shaft of is weapon as a greatclub.

When Demogorgon emerged from the waters, Dad began to suffer from madness, causing him to start screaming uncontrolably. Eldeth was able to get Dad moving and eventually got him out of the altar. Since neither of them had anything to grab back at the inn, they ran their way into the tunnels of the Underdark, eventually running in to Sarith and [Hemeth](../party/hemeth.md). Dad heavily encouraged the others to go to Neverlight Grove, but this required that they pass through Gracklstugh along the way, much to his discontent.

### [Dangers of the Darklake](../../sessions/arc03/info.md)
While looking for food outside Sloobludop, Dad, Sarith, and Ront encountered a drow scouting party and began to run. He split up with Ront then Sarith attempting to evade the party and encountered a strange creature roaming the tunnels. The creature encountered a drow scout and they disappeared together into the tunnels. Dad eventually reunited with Sarith and the rest of the party left behind where they ventured into Sloobludop for the others, ecountering Ront along the way.

During combat on the boat, Dad did a considerable amount of damage to the aquatic troll and the darkmantles. While fighting the darkmantles, he stood at the front of the boat and yelled what he could see to the others.

While others rested or ventured into the tunnels, Dad nearly did all the boat repairs himself, finding salvage amongst the shore, and was assisted by Sarith and Groggle in repairing the boat. When Hemeth returned, Dad was suspicious when he was carrying Alias' dagger. Together with Ebadius, Groggle, and Hemeth, he ventured into the tunnels to find Alias before setting off on the boat.

During the battle with the duergar traders, Dad was a one-man army. He did a skilled jump onto the opposing boat, went into a rage and critically injured a trader, then jumped back to the party's boat without taking any damage himself. He afterwards apologized to the crew for the misunderstanding, stating that he thought that the duergar were trying to rob them. 

When the party encountered the second green hag, Dad moved into position with Alias and Ront to restrain her. Dad convinced Ront to bite her, but then struggled to keep hold of her as she started writhing, in which Dad told him to kill her.

Dad traveled with Alias, Ebadius, and Sarith to look for food in the tunnels. After much food was found, Dad returned it to the boat before venturing back into the tunnels. When Sarith switched with Groggle, Dad helped slay the first wave of gnolls deeper in the tunnels. When Alias discovered more gnolls, Dad attacked them head on in a fit of rage and nearly fended off the 8 gnolls single-handedly, with a bit of assistance from the others. During this combat, Dad never missed an attack. He later looted the pack leader and retained the gems he was carrying, telling no one about it.

Dad was asleep when arriving at the island in the middle of the darklake. He awoke once a panic began on the boat as the party heard Shuushar screaming. Dad led the charge to look for Shuushar, steering everyone in the right direction. When Shuushar was found, Dad was able to avoid being attacked by the strange fungus tree and eventually struck down the arm holding him. When Shuushar got trapped again, Dad again freed him.

When arms began erupting from the ground on the island, Dad assisted in gettingg others free, such as Edleth and Shuushar, before running back to the boat. After Sarith grabbed Groggle, Dad struck him over the head and never left his side, fearful that he was a threat.

Dad, together with Ebadius, moved to restrain Hemeth during the mutiny on the boat. He also mocked Hemeth a few times as Hemeth tried to explain how the crew was acting outside of reason.

When the party docked in the tunnels, Dad traveled with Ront to look for food. They found leathery fungi that they ignored, then found some bluecaps to bring back to the boat. When they returned they learned about Garmel from Alias and Groggle, Dad traveled with Ebadius, Ront, and a bound Sarith to collect food. When they heard voices, Dad hid from view until he felt the travelers were safe.

When Hemeth suggested to the party that they arrive to Gracklstugh through the main gates, Dad determined that he was lying, and Sarith corrected him. Dad remained mostly quiet on the boat as they traveled, letting the others make decisions for him.

## Relationships
Dad's best relationship is with his party member Ront, as the two of them have very similar approaches to problem solving. They share a mutual bond of agression and often do whatever the other one is doing. Dad is a bit more take-charge than Ront is, again possibly alluding to a possible past involving father-like tendcies. His other strong relationship is with Sarith, which initially began as an extremely rough relationship. Early on, Dad was aggressive toward Sarith, primarily due to Sarith's aloof behavior and lack of will to discuss what he may have known of the drow (as well as being a suspect in Jimjar's death). After the two of the helped each other evade drow capture and saved each other's life, the two of them developed a strong friendship.

While he does not have many negative relationships with party members, he seems to have very neutral connections with others. He does not seem to interact with Eldeth or Groggle in many instances, although he does not appear to have issue with them. While he did reflect on Stool after he disappeared, Dad did not have a particularly strong connection with him.

Dad has a strong dislike of Hemeth, likely due to Hemeth's demanding attitude. This friction resulted in him assisting in the mutiny that placed Alias in charge. While Shuushar does like Dad, Dad dislike's Shuushar's pacifism and often tries to rouse him to action, never being successful. He was also distrustful of Buppido, who he assumed had some sort of hidden agenda.

## Trivia
* Dad is particularly skilled at doing backflips, even with his hulking size. In his entire time in the Underdark he had injured several enemies with them and has never failed to do a backflip when trying. He did, however, perform a backlip into a waterfall, hoping that there would be a hidden cave behind it, but there was just a rock face.
* The first weapon Dad found in the Underdark he named "Dr. Lobotomy". Based on his level of intelligence, it is possible that he has had a lobotomy himself or knows someone who has had one.
* After escaping Sloobludop, the party realized that they had lost Buppido and Stool. Dad expressed his thoughts that, while he was sad that Stool was gone because we was a fine companion, he kindly said that it was for the best that Buppido did not return, seeing as he always acted as a loner. This was his polite way of saying good riddance to Buppido, who Dad did not like.
* While fighting the gnolls in the tunnels, Dad nearly single-handedly defeated all of the ordinary gnolls by himself b going into a rage. He did request healing from Groggle, but it turned out that even without the healing he would have survived.
