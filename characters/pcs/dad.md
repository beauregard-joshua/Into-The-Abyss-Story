## Personality
Dad's personality is agressive and blunt. He is not very intelligent, so he often immedietely says what comes to his mind, which is often not the most eloquent phrase. As an example, Dad once intimidated one of his party members on watch to ask if he had killed somone, actually holding him in the air to get his answer.

Although his demeanor is tough, Dad is actually a person that strives for good. He seems somewhat resourceful and uses everything he has to his advantage. Throughout his time in the Underdark he has given his support for finding food and supplies, as well as fighting off some dangerous foes.

Dad is a bit arrogant, and his lack of intelligence lets this get to him at times. He often listens to the people that praise him, which leads to him following people that may or may not have any real respect for him.

## Background
Little is known about Dad and his background. He is surprisingly wise for an orc and makes a lot of "dad" jokes, leading to the possibility that he is actually a father and has a family somewhere.

## Relationships
Dad's best relationship is with his party member Ront, an orc that found his way into the Underdark and into the Velknevelve prison. They share a mutual bond of agression and often do whatever the other one is doing. Dad also has a strong relationship with Alias Fakename, although he is unaware that Alias is mostly manipulating him.

Other the other side, Dad has had a mixed relationship with Sarith Kzekarit, mostly stemming from a fear of a murderer in their party. Dad and Sarith once had a decent relationship, but ever since Dad felt threatened and confronted Sarith their relationship has suffered. Dad also is distrustful of Buppido, who he assumes has some sort of hidden agenda.

## Trivia
* Dad is particularly skilled at doing backflips, even with his hulking size. In his entire time in the Underdark he had injured several enemies with them and has never failed to do a backflip when trying.
* The first weapon Dad found in the Underdark he named "Dr. Lobotomy". Based on his level of intelligence, it is possible that he has had a lobotomy himself or knows someone who has had one.
