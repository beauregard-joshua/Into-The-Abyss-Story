## Personality
Groggle is an optimistic, friendly, and fairly quiet person. As expected of a bard he is quite musical and often tries to use music to spur the party's morale. He tries to use anything that he sees as a musical instrument, such as chamber pots or rocks. He is not necessarily outspoken and he will often go with the flow of his companions, but he makes sure that his ideas are heard enough to at least hold merit.

While a bit quiet, Groggle is indeed adventurous. For example, when exploring the lost city of Alversin with [Ebadius](ebadius.md) and [Shuushar](../party/shuushar.md), the three of them explored a seemingly haunted castle and encountered several scary things before leaving. He also personally faced a giant spider in Velkenvelve, even when on its own webbing.

This courage could come from Groggle's resourcefulness. Groggle has made use of improvised weapons as well as maneuvering his way through tricky situations. For example, Groggle was able to calm an aggressive giant spider and ride it for a time. In addition, in a spectacular feat, Groggle was able to convince an enemy drow to turn away while looking for his party.

## Background
Groggle came from a small village somewhere on the surface in which had some form of a revolution. He admitted to participating in the revolution as well when questioned by others about whether or not killing was an acceptable act, where he further added that he learned methods of healing. It was during these difficult times that he learned his craft for medicine.

His musical skills imply that Groggle may have attended a bard's college somewhere, although it is unlikely that he would have attended it in his small village.

## Story
### [The Prison at Velkenvelve](../../sessions/arc01/info.md)
Groggle arrived at Velkenvelve with Ebadius and Sarith as the first set of prisoners. Groggle immedietely began making the best of a bad situation, trying to play music on chamber pots and making the food palletable. He began performing menial chores, such as stacking rocks. He asked one of the guards why he was stakcing rocks, and was slogged in the face.

Groggle was with [Alias](alias.md) and Sarith when a fight broke out in the mess hall. Groggle slowly followed behind Alias as they entered a room with a giant statue of Lolth, where the two of them briefly fought a priestess. After leaving he followed Sarith down into the spiderwebs where they encountered another giant spider, which Groggle was able to befriend and ride. From here Groggle was unable to do much until he was shot with a poisoned bolt and knocked unconscious. Groggle awoke in the prison cell when the guards arrived and used him as an example, beating him within an inch of his life.

When Sarith started a brawl outside, Groggle was in the prison cell when the party was able to break out. Led by Ebadius and Alias, Groggle escaped prison with Shuushar, [Stool](../party/stool.md), [Jimjar](../party/jimjar.md), [Topsy](../party/topsy.md), and [Turvy](../party/turvy.md). He stayed in the back and watched their backs as demons arrived and the guards scrambled. When he entered the armory he wast struck with a *locust swarm* spell from [Ilvara](../velkenvelve/ilvara.md) and was knocked out. After he was resuscitated the party began to panic as a large demon perched itself on the armory. Groggle was one of the last to leave, jumping out of the armory and following Shuushar and Jimjar down into the water. The three escaped from the pool before the ooze caight them.

After meeting up with the party, Groggle voted to travel to Sloobludop, as it was the closest place.

### [Travel to Sloobludop](../../sessions/arc02/info.md)
As a caster, Groggle supported the party mostly from the back of the pack. He was farily silent during their trip, letting the others guide their way into the lost coty of Alversin. He helped search the buildings with everyone else, finding a few odds and ends, such as a bottle of wine. On the second day of exploration, Groggle, Ebadius, and Shuushar all investigated the central castle. Together they ecnountered some eerie noises and whispers and decided to leave without finding anything.

When the party encountered a group of formerly enslaved goblins, Groggle cast *bane* and shouted "we mean you no harm", to which his party decided to kill three of them and let a fourth one go.

Later that night as the drow caught up with them, Groggle cast *suggestion* and conviced the drow that they weren't there, rescuing the party. He then followed behind as they made their escape through the cave. He supplied the wine he had found and played music for his party as they fell asleep.

When Eldeth found Jimjar stabbed to death, Groggle mostly kept quiet and watched the reactions of others as people began pointing fingers. He never made his suspicions known if he had any, but he did ask a few questions of the group to indicate that he was trying to piece it all together. While he was unable to deterine anything, he did stay close to a few people, such as Sarith and Stool, who he supposedly still trusts.

Groggle mostly stayed back during the fight in the fungus cavern, steering clear of the spore clouds. After the clouds settled he went to the aid of Ront, who had inhaled a lot of the spores. After he drank the water anc claimed it tasted weird, Groggle used *lesser restoration* to pick him back up before exiting the cavern with everyone, led by Alias.

After traveling for a day Groggle was on watch with Ebadius and Shuushar. Shuushar revealed some dangerous facts about kuo-toan culture that made Groggle rethink (and possibly regret) his vote for Sloobludop. The next day of travel ended with Alias, Ebadius, Groggle, and Buppdio investigating some voices that they had heard from a nearvy cavern, unable to find anything. He also tried to heal the infection on Sarith's face, but it only seemed to burn him in the process. During his watch with Ebadius and [Buppido](../party/buppido.md) the party was awoken by a screaming Sarith, to which Groggle said little.

For much of the remaining travel to Sloobludop Groggle stayed quiet and deferred to Ebadius and Alias for decision making. He stayed somewhat back when encountering the rogue kuo-toa and joined up with Plooplooppeen when he arrived, citing that they needed a safe place to stay.

When in town, Groggle and Ebadius sold much of Alias' spoils together. They sold much to the curiosity shop and had other objects appraised, but his biggest achievement was the purchasing of a drum that sounded like a horn playing C# when struck. He used this instrument to do some street performances, but it did not work out, but he was successful in rallying the patrons of the inn using his drum and some "ham-bonin'". The next morning, Groggle purchased a few crossbow bolts for himself.

Unsure of who was an enemy and who was a friend, Groggle did little to aid the fight in the Altar of the Deep Father. Once Demogorgon revealed himself from the waters, Groggle was one of the few people who kept themselves together and commanded people to escape. He was the one calmed Eldeth down and convinced her to get [Dad](dad.md) out of the altar.

When escaping Sloobludop, Groggle teamed up with Ebadius as they retrieved their belongings from the inn. He was able to signal to their party members that they were coming down the tunnels by using using magic drum and the two of them met up with Sarith, [Hemeth](../party/hemeth.md), Dad, Eldeth, Shuushar, and Ront.

### [Dangers of the Darklake](../../sessions/arc03/info.md)
Groggle joined up with Alias, Ebadius, and Shuushar to investigate the ruins of Sloobludop after Demogorgon's attack. He successfully found several parts of boat wreckage that could be salvaged to make a new boat for traversing the darklake. He helped assemble the boat before departing. While rowing, Groggle spent most of his efforts healing others fighting monsters and rowing the boat, but was unable to avoid damage.

While others rested or ventured into the tunnels, Groggle chose to aid in the repairs of the boat, but wasn't particularly helpful. He teamed up with Dad and Sarith who did most of the work.

Groggle mostly stayed out of the way during the combat with the duergar traders. He mentioned that he felt put off about the need for combat and would be considering this when making future decisions. He tried to help Sarith as they rescued Ront from the water before sailing away. He voiced his concerns to the party afterward about how he was not okay with the events that transpired, and was happy to hear that others were not okay with the situation as well.

When fighting the green hag on the boat, she reached for Groggle, but he managed to slip away just in time. Groggle successfully cast *bane* on the her, but the hag jumped back into the water and his efforts were for naught.

After running the boat aground, Groggle stayed back to examine any damages to the boat, but found none. He stayed there until Sarith told him to join up with the others in the tunnels. He fought with the first pack of gnolls, missing several crossbow shots, but killing the final gnoll. He then provided covering fire for Dad as they fought the remaining gnolls and offered healing to the party as they struggled against the pack leader.

Groggle was the to identify the island in the darklake, and guided the party into docking the boat. He stayed behind while Shuushar explored, but spring into action when he heard him yelp. He, together with Shuushar and Eldeth, quickly ran back to the boat while the others deliberated. Back on the boat, Sarith grabbed Groggle, but was stopped by the other party members before Sarith could do anything. When Sarith told the party to let him go, Groggle expressed to him that he was their friend and that they would find a cure for whatever was wrong with him in Gracklstugh.

Groggle was nominated as either captain or first mate of the ship, but instead chose to vote for Alias and Shuushar.

Once docked, Groggle went out to look for food with Alias and eventually found their way into a crystal cavern. Groggle heard weezing and helped find their way to Garmel, and Groggle healed him back to life. The learned about nearby food and returned to the boat with Alias to inform the party. Once their, Groggle returned to the cavern, this time with Eldeth, to gather crystals for the party. He tested their brightness by throwing one on the ground, preparing to use them as weapons.

When the drow traders came through the cavern, Groggle and Eldeth hid until they passed through. After hearing from Alias that they encountered drow traders as well, he was a little less chaken about the encounter.

Groggle kept mostly silent on the boat to Gracklstugh. He was able to smell the scents from the forges and made this known, alerting the party to their nearing arrival.

### [The City of Blades](../../sessions/arc04/info.md)

Groggle was able to notice something being fired from the walls of Grakclstugh as Alias tried to infiltrate. He encouraged the party to turn back for her and Alias rejoined the party.

As the party tried to negotiate with Hemeth to have him help with docking, Groggle eventually offered a trade of the boat for his assistance. Hemeth agreed under the additional condition that they will never see each other again, and they agreed. Groggle was the fifth to arrive at Gholbrorn's Lair, arriving after Sarith and before Ebadius. He met up with two deep gnomes who were extremely interested in the fact that Groggle was a surface gnome and bought him a few drinks while listening to his stories. Groggle was eventually handed a note by Dad stating he was leaving to explore the town.

Groggle eventually started a game of three-dragon with the deep gnomes, Ront, and Ebadius, when Alias and Dad arrived with Werz. Groggle healed him, and Ebadius escorted him to the nearby gates. Groggle eventually heard the rumbling of the stone giant outside, but confused it for Themberchaud. He was unable to get a good look at it, but once Alias said that it was not a dragon he moved to investigate with Alias, Dad, Eldeth, and Ront. Groggle moved to engage the giant when it attacked him. He took substantial damage and retreated behind Ebadius, who had also arrived.

Groggle spent the end of the battle healing the party as well as healing the injured within the city. When they returned to the inn, Groggle agreed to travel to the Shattered Spire with Ebadius in the coming day.

The nex day, Dad asked Groggle for assistance in his and Ront's arm wrestling scheme in town. Groggle politely said that his idea needed more work, but he would be happy to help advertise for it. He then traveled to a clothing store to buy the standard Gracklstugh outfit.

Groggle traveled with Ebadius to the Shattered Spire to meet with Werz. There, they spoke with him about the strange events going on in Gracklstugh, although Ebadius was forced to translate for Groggle. They were given supplies to deliver to someone in Blingdenstone and Groggle promised to keep Werz informed as best as they could before they left. After leaving, they met up with Alias and Eldeth and traveled to the Shattered Spire to receive travel passes into Gracklstugh, where they were taken into custody by Errde Blackskull. Groggle was the first to cave about the truth, thinking that it was better to not dig themselves a larger hole and possibly gain some information within the city.

Groggle then returned to the Gholbrorn's Lair with Alias to talk with the patrons to gather information. There he took a short rest before attempting to locate Shuushar, which led them to the darlake. After waiting a few minutes, the two of them met with Ylsa Henstak and learned that the derro were getting surface goods. They struck a deal to give her this information in exchange for maps of the underdark.

When Dad arrived at the Blade Bazaar, Groggle and Alias joined him in searching for Droki. They were led down an alleyway when Dad said they were being followed. After dad confronted and assaulted the drow, Groggle requested that he place her down. He then escorted her to Errde Blackskull's office as per her request. After returning to his allies and learning that she was looking for them, Groggle insisted that the duergar might turn them over, and they all moved to escape. Groggle went to the archives to retrieve Ebadius and then joined everyone by the dock.

## Relationships
Groggle is widely accepted amongst his party members, although he does not connect strongly with many of them, actually being fearful of many of them. There are few others that he confides in or trusts, such as Sarith and Shuushar, who seem to him to be the most level headed members of the party. He does divulge a bit of information with Ebadius at times, possibly because they arrived together at Velkenvelve. While he has not particularly bonded with either Dad or Ront, Groggle has done a decent job keeping them calm and focused, commanding at least a bit of respect.

Other members of the party, such as Alias, have mixed opinions of Groggle, mainly due to his occassional versatility. Groggle has established himself as a reliable and level-headed party member, and often find him to be useful, although not particularly outspoken, and so is often overlooked in major decisions.

Through his kindness, Groggle does not have many negative relationships with his party. Besides the fact that he had escaped Velkenvelve, Groggle did make enemies of the guards at the prison by speaking his mind and acting relaxed, even when times were tough. The one party member that Groggle actively has a negative relationship with his Hemeth, who has been very rude toward the others, such as Shuushar.

## Trivia
* Groggle is a very good improvisationist, although he has shown confusion when completing tasks he did not expect would work. For example, after taming a giant spider, he audibly stated "now I don't know what to do."
* Groggle refers to all his musical ventures as "ham-bonin'", regardless of what instrument is being used.
* The purchasing for the drum in Sloobludop marked the first musical instrument Groggle had obtained the whole adventure. Unfortunately this instrument cost 50gp and has caused others to boo him for his efforts.
* Groggle singlehandedly found the parts necessary to construct a boat for traversing the darklake, despite his lack of knowledge of boats.
