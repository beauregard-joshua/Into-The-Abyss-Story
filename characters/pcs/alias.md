## Personality
Alias is a secretive and calculating person that is always looking for a new gambit to get what she wants. She doesn't completely detach herself from her companions, but she often sees her companions as a means to an end. As an example, Alias has a fairly good relationship with Eldeth, even so much as to say as she is trying to form a relationship, while her demeanor with [Dad](dad.md) is often a bit manipulative, boosting his ego to make sure that he will listen to her.

Alias is well organized and calculating, having no difficulties coming up with a plan or strategy. These strategies may be short term and simply be quick ploys, or may involve larger schemes, such as tricking her companions or searching for something lost to her. As an example, Alias heavily advocated for [Shuushar](../party/shuushar.md) to be her first mate on the darklake, whie partly for his knowledge of the terrain, it was mostly for her ability to remove his command as necessary for her own.

## Background
Little is known about Alias and her background. She has used the name of someone in discussions with others, implying that there is someone she may know in the underdark, but she has not confided the truth in anyone.

## Story
### [The Prison at Velkenvelve](../../sessions/arc01/info.md)
Alias arrived at Velkenvelve in the second wave of prisoners, together with Dad and [Buppido](../party/buppido.md) and after the group of [Ebadius](ebadius.md), [Groggle](groggle.md), and Sarith. Her first interpretation of everyone was that she was surrounded by incompetent people and would need to organize the others to get out. She connected a bit with Sarith, who had the most information to give, and kept the others at a bit of a distance.

The prisoners were separated into two groups to perform menial chores to keep them busy. Alias was grouped with Groggle and Sarith and tasked with cleaning laundry at the waterfall. Alias found some rope tucked into a crevice when she heared yelling from the mess hall. Alias moved closer to the mess hall to see the cause and was thrown into a wall by [Ilvara](../velkenvelve/ilvara.md), who made her first appearance. Alias infiltrated the room she came from to find the statue of Lolth and tried to topple it, but was surprised to find another priestess and a giant spider. She and Groggle left and followed Sarith's advice to jump down to the webs.

In the webs, Alias, Groggle and Sarith eventually met up with Dad who had fallen from the ledge above. Worried about the slime beneath, Alias tried climbing the rock wall out until the guards came to retrieve them. They were escorted back to their cell, where they met with Eldeth and [Jimjar](../party/jimjar.md) and eventually of the prisoners. Alias quickly got Eldeth on her side and began courting her. 

Alias was also the only character who could speak with prince [Derendil](../party/derendil.md), who was an elf polymorphed into a quaggoth. While Derendil spoke of his heritage, Alias had no knowledge of his family or kingdom. She spoke with him and assured him that they would escape together.

When Sarith, Eldeth, and Dad started a commotion during their chores, Alias and Ebadius led the charge from the prison cell to escape. They entered the armory and while Ebadius held off the guards Alias climbed the ladder and began throwing weapons and armor down for the party. After the guards were incapacitated a swooping demon snapped the bridge, leaving a single thread of spider silk that Alias climbed across to reach the opposing ledge. Ilvara cast *hold person* on her, but lost concentration from the demons and Alias jumped down to the spider webs. She met up with Ebadius and Buppido and escaped with Dad on the elevator.

After their escape, Alias voted to travel to Sloobludop, which was the closest settlement to where they were.

### [Travel to Sloobludop](../../sessions/arc02/info.md)
Alias mostly led the party as a scout, providing reconnaissance while following traveling instructions from Shuushar. When the party encountered the large cavern of the lost city of Alversin, Alias and Eldeth scouted forward looking for an obvious way forward. While the party marched forward and Eldeth and Dad began to panic, Alias calmed them down and marched them on.

Alias spent most of her time in Alversin searching debris, finding some food and a few odds and ends. She eventually followed Ebadius when he claimed he saw someone outside the walls, but she was unable to find anything. She also helped walk the perimeter to search for supplies, and did one final search with Eldeth and [Stool](../party/stool.md) before moving out.

While Alias did not kill any of the goblins in the tunnel, she did appear to scare them and became worried that Eldeth would judge her for this action.

While on watch in the tunnels with Eldeth, Alias heard people moving through the tunnels. She tried to distract them, but unfortunately drew their attention. She and Eldeth eventually were able to sneak out with the others.

Later with Alias and Eldeth on watch, Eldeth found Jimjar murdered. Alias filled a vial with water and convinced the party that it was a truth serum and told the party to drink it. When no one confessed, Alias said that it must have been a weak dose and wasnt't enough to get everyone to speak the truth. She then told everyone to relax and get some sleep, waking up when Dad threatened Sarith, then again convinced everyone to sleep.

Alias discovered the agressive mushrooms in the fungus cavern and alerted everyone to their advanceent on the party. She led the party out of the cave while Ebadius destroyed the walls to release the water, releasing pressurized air as well.

In her travels to Sloobludop, Alias became increasingly suspicious of Sarith, who spoke to her and admitted that he had no interest in making friends any longer. She also became more suspicous of Buppido, who spoke very bluntly and didn't try to evade speaking of tough subjects. He also mentioned that he was suspicious of Ebadius, who was "too strong to be a sorcerer" and that he "has the means." On the next day of travel she bonded more with Shuushar and learned a bit more about kuo-toa culture in the process. After Sarith woke up in a fit of rage, Alias quickly handed off her rope to Dad who tied his hands up.

Alias was able to get one strike on the enemy grell the party encountered before Dad killed it, where she then helped cut up the grell for food.

While on watch, Alias spoke with Sarith for the first time in a while positively, where Sarith confessed that he was thankful that he was still trusted. She also spoke some more with Shuushar about Sloobldop and kuo-toan culture.

Alias found an advancing kuo-toa party while scouting, which began yelling. Ebadius listened to the party and told them to run, and Alias pulled Shuushar back as they escaped to a nearby cave. Alias and Sarith then follow close behind Shuushar with Ebadius behind them as Shuushar attempts to parlay with the kuo-toa, but he finds himself captured. Sarith convinces Alias to wait and follow the kuo-toa to Sloobludop, but plans change when she sees a new band of kuo-toa intercept them. She killed a kuo-toa guard with Sarith and rescues Shuushar, then ushered Shuushar to again parlay with the kuo-toa.

In Sloobludop, Alias took the opportunity to investigate his party members. She and Eldeth investigated the rooms of their party members to look for clues as to who might be the murderer amongst them, but were unable to find anything. She had also passed off much of her inventory to Ebadius and Groggle to sell to local stores and gave much of her money to Eldeth to buy supplies. Alias also, cleverly using thieves' cant, purchased thieves tools from a local merchant.

In the night, Alias followed Buppido as he went for a walk around town, but mostly concluded that "he was weird." 

While the rest of the party acted to infiltrate the [cult of the Deep Father](../../lore/organizations/deepfather.md), Alias stayed behind and wanted from afar. When her party entered the altar, she moved behind the statue of [Leemooggoogoon](../../lore/demon_lords/demogorgon.md) to attack. As the attack started, she tried to distract the kuo-tao by mimicking the Deep Father, but once [Demogorgon](../../lore/demon_lords/demogorgon.md) arose from the water she swam through the water, broke [Hemeth](../party/hemeth.md) free, then escaped. Alias quickly looted the general store before escaping back into the tunnels. She was one of the last party members to meet up in the Underdark, aside from Stool and Buppido, who were not found.

### [Dangers of the Darklake](../../sessions/arc03/info.md)
Alias was one of the party members, along with Ebadius, Groggle, and Shuushar, to return to Sloobludop after Demogorgon's release. She helped loot ruined buildings while the others searched for salvage for building a boat. When the others arrived and reported that the drow had found them, Alias kept watch while the others built the boat before departing. During the combat on the boat, Alias was severely injured by an aquatic troll, but was healed by Groggle so she could keep fighting. After the first boat docking, she scouted ahead and heard some noises in the cave. When she reported this to the party, they decided to keep traveling down the darklake.

Alias and Hemeth investigated the tunnels until they found a group of quaggoths that appeared to have mushrooms growing on their heads. Alias ventured further while Hemeth turned back to warn the others. Alias encountered several strange things, most notably a voice that said "You're going to wish you hadn't done that", that spoke after she took an axe from a skeleton, as well as a collection of whispering voices. She returned to the party and urgently moved everyone out.

Alias ended up arguing with Hemeth as to who would captain the ship, but backed down as things got heated.

During the battle with the duergar traders, Alias most notably attempted to jump to their boat but was unsuccessful, crashing into the water below and being rescued by Eldeth. Afterwards, Alias confronted Ebadius about his actions, raising tensions a bit.

Alias, together with Ebadius, managed to pull the green hag onto the boat, although Alias did not know it was a hag at the time. When confronted with the second hag, Alias went with Dad and Ront to confront her, and immediately identified her as a hag. She tied her up and let Dad and Ront take care of her.

Alias went with Dad, Ebadius, and Sarith to look for food. After Alias scouted ahead and found some gnolls, Sarith went back to defend the boat and Groggle joined the pack, and together they killed the first wave of gnolls. She then scouted ahead and found the remaining gnolls before returning to develop a plan of attack. She damaged the pack leader but sustained serious wounds and was forced to retreat. After the pack leader was killed, she took its longbow for herself and delivered its glaive to Dad.

When Shuushar investigated the island in the darklake, Alias was at the ready for anything bad to happen. When Shuushar let out a scream, Alias began running into the forest and was led by Dad to finding Shuushar. When arms started erupting from the ground, Alias had to pull Ebadius away from the commotion to get them all onto the boat.

While dealing with Sarith, Alias began hallucinating Buppido giving her advice. With the complication between Sarith's attack on Groggle and her hallucinations, Alias voiced that she was not okay and needed help.

Alias, together with Ebadius and Dad, helped perform a mutiny on the ship to remove Hemeth from his position. She was elected (nearly unanimously) as the new captain and successfully encouraged others to elect Shuushar as her first mate.

When the party docked in the tunnels, Alias traveled with Groggle into a crystal cluster where they encountered Garmel. She refused to take his money and simply thanked him for the information he had to offer as to where to find food. They returned to the boat where she took the place of Eldeth, who was guarding Hemeth. When Shuushar returned, they made small talk as they awaited the return of their party.

Alias pressed Hemeth for questions while traveling to Gracklstugh, and was able to get Hemeth to speak out a lie, caught by both Dad and Sarith. She also suggested to the party a stealthy approach into Gracklstugh for fear that a group of nine strangers might attract some attention. She was also able to smell the metallic scent of forges as they approached the city.

### [The City of Blades](../../sessions/arc04/info.md)
As the party arrived in view of Gracklstugh, Alias planned to scout the city before the others. After discussing with the party, Alias was made invisible by Ebadius and swam to shore. She discovered the guards waiting in the walls of the city and taunted them by backing ghost sounds and messing with their crossbow bolts. After being shot several times and unsuccessfully shaking the guards, she saw the boat turn round and she left to rejoin the party.

When Alias rejoined the party, she stayed mostly quiet while the party negotiated with Hemeth on the boat. She was the second to last to arrive at Gholbrorn's Lair, arriving after Ebadius and before Dad. She witnessed a discussion between Sarith and Shuushar and learned that Shuushar went to explore the city. Alias found him at a stall being yelled at by a merchant before sending him back to the inn.

Alias then ran into Dad on the streets where the two of them saw a duergar on the docks being stabbed. The two waited for the assassins to disappear before helping the man. Dad stablized the man and carried him back to the inn, and when Alias attempted to ask him who thse people were he was very evasive.

When Alias heard the commotion outside the inn, she moved to investigate, thinking it was the dragon Themberchaud. When she saw that it was a giant with two heads, she returned to the inn to inform everyone of what was happening. As Groggle, Ront, and Eldeth followed here, Alias took a shot at one of the heads of the giant to draw its attention. During the fight, she kept a safe distance before closing in to attempt to stabilize a dying Ront. Alias kept back as the second giant arrived and kept her friends safe. Once Eldeth said that the guards planned on killing the giant, Alias moved in with Eldeth to stop the guard. She gave her information and returned to the inn.

While the party discussed their plans for the next day, Alias made the plan to explore the city with Dad and Eldeth and investigate the giant attack. Alias first noticed that Ront was behaving strangely and got everyone to help him. Alias checked on Sarith and told him what happened, who suggested that he and Shuushar remain separate from the party, since their identites were compromised.

When the party split in Gracklstugh, Alias traveled with Eldeth to see the giants, but were turned away from the other districts of the city. They met up with Ebadius and Groggle and traveled to Overlake Hold to receive travel passes, but were taken to Errde Blackskull's office with Ront and explained the situation regarding the drow. Alias was mostly quiet during the discussion, letting other make the major decisions for her. She was enlisted with Errde with Ebadius and Groggle and taken to the armory, where she was ouftiftted with gear.

After leaving the hold with Groggle, Alias ran into Dad being taken to the hold by several stoneguard. She followed them and waited for Errde. When Dad went into a rage, Alias held Dad back and calmed him down before he was taken to Gartokkar Xundorn. After this event, Alias returned to Gholbrorn's Lair to meet up with Groggle to find Shuushar and Sarith. As Gorggle took a short rest, Alias met Steve, who gave her the advice to meet with Ylsa Henstak for information regarding the surface. When Alias went to follow Steve, he disapeared.

Alias and Groggle left to locate Shuushar, and learned that he was likely in the darklake. After waiting a bit, they met with Ylsa Henstak, who told them that the derro are getting surface goods and tasked them with finding out how, and in return promised them maps for traversing the underdark.

Dad met up with Alias and Groggle in the Blade Bazaar. The three of them looked for Droki until Dad led them down an alleyway and revealed that they were being followed by a drow. After Dad confronted the drow, Alias frisked the drow and stole a paper from her that contained drawings of the party that escaped Velkenvelve, for which Alias agreed with Groggle that they should try to escape before the drow struck a deal with the stioneguard.

Alias saw Sarith being taken into custody at Overlake Hold, and helped throw him in jail while leaving the gate unlocked. She passed this information along to Ebadius before leaving the hold with Groggle and Dad to meet by the docks to discuss their next move. There, they decided to defect to the Keeper's of the Flame for protection, and traveled to Themberchaud's Lair to speak with him and Gartokkar. Alias did much of the talking with Gartokkar and became enraged when Ebadius sabotaged their progress by insinuating that he was not actually in charge. Alias took two swings and Ebadius, but missed both times.

Alias then joined the others into Themberchaud's cavern once he called for them. After leaving, she worked with Ebadius for him to translate statements from Droki to make a decision as to where to head next. They decided to enter the Whorlstone tunnels following droki and his deliveries. Once Droki escaped through a crack in the wall, Alias tried to chase after Droki but ate the wrong mushroom, causing her to grow in size instead of shrink. She then found the correct mushroom and ate it twice to sneak through the crack with Dad and Eldeth.

## Relationships
Alias attempted to have a romantic relationship with Eldeth and had been courting her for much of their journey. Through this connection, Eldeth appears to listen to mish of what Alias has to say, also considering that Alias takes charge in the party. Eldeth expressed her desire to remain friends with Alias, and while she was disappointed, Alias remains friends with Eldeth to this day.

Alias was also one of the few party members to bond with Stool, and this connection appears to be one of the few that show compassion from Alias. She also has a strangely positive connection with Dad, which is mostly in order to manipulate Dad into doing acts that are useful for Alias, or more commonly for the party as a whole. Alias often boosts Dad's ego in order to convince him to do what Alias wishes, although unknown to her Dad is aware of this behavior. 

Alias has a rocky relationship with Hemeth, as the two of them have often worked well together in planning and strategizing, although they have often argued about what is fair and who is in command. Beyond that, Alias does not have many negative relationships with people, although this is possibly because of her keeping her distance from others and not bonding too much with the party. She doesn't speak much with others like Ront and spoke little to Buppido, and while Alias might not care for them their true feelings remain unknown.

## Trivia
* Alias is quite skilled in several primary skills, but is notorious amongst her party members for being unlucky, and she often struggles to do things she has been trained to do, such as throwing objects for a distraction or climbing rock faces.
* Eldeth had become aware at some point that Alias had an interest in her, and the two of them had to have a difficult conversation in which she turned Alias down.
* Alias had not seen Groggle perform any type of bardic ability for the first several days that they were together, and actually thought that Groggle was one of the more useless members of the party until she heard that Groggle had helped heal Ront previously.
* There as been a noticeable (albeit slight) change in Alias' personality over the course of travel. She began much more cold-hearted, loking out for herself, but showed compassion when she ran into Garmel with Groggle in the tunnels.
