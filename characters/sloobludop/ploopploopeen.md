![Ploopploopeen](Ploopploopeen.png)

Ploopploopeen was a male kuo-toa first encountered outside the town of Sloobludop. He was the high priest of the church of the Sea Mother before the destruction of Sloobludop at the hands of [Demogorgon](../../lore/demon_lords/demogorgon.md).

## Personality
As with most kuo-toa, Ploopploopeen has a personality that is a bit erratic and eccentric. Following kuo-toa customs, he has a strong desire to be standing above others while he is speaking, which proves difficult when speaking with larger creatures. He forces respect out of those he speaks with and enforces his position of power amongst his disciples, although not in a belittling way. He thinks very highly of himself overall.

Although a bit arrogant and self-centered, Ploopploopeen is caring for his people. He had expressed deep concern with how the schism between the church of the Sea Mother and [cult of the Deep Father](../../lore/organizations/deepfather.md) was affecting the people of Sloobludop. He expressed distress over the tension caused by his daughter [Bloppblippodd](bloppblippodd.md) who became the archpriest of the cult of the Deep Father. In true nature to the kuo-toa, however, Ploopploopeen held no reservations about killing his daughter for the sake of the Sea Mother.

## Background
Little is known about Ploopploopeen's background, especially regarding how he ascended to the position of archpriest. Due to his brief conversations with [Shuushar](../party/shuushar.md), the two appear to have an amiable history, and Shuushar spoke of Ploopploopeen in very high regard. Ploopploopeen also has two children; his elder daughter is Bloppblippodd, who became the archpriest of the cult of the Deep Father, and his younger son [Glooglugogg](glooglugogg.md), who has remained apart of the church of the Sea Mother.

## Story
### [Travel to Sloobludop](../../sessions/arc02/info.md)
Ploopploopeen was first seen leading a group of kuo-toa into the caverns of the underdark to defeat the scouts sent by the cult of the Deep Father. With the assistance of several members of the party, such as [Alias](../pcs/alias.md) and [Sarith](../party/sarith.md), the team was able to defeat the cult's scouts. The party spoke with Ploopploopeen about the schism occuring between the two religous factions within Sloobludop and explained his plan to offer the party to the cult as fake sacrifices to remove the cult for good. After they accepted, Ploopploopeen brought them the rest of the way to Sloobludop.

Within Sloobludop, Ploopploopeen led the party to the town's inn and offered them free food and a place to stay in exhcange for there assistance. The next day, Ploopploopeen spent most of his day discussing matters with Shuushar and his son Glooglogogg regarding the place for the infiltration. When Glooglugogg spoke out against this idea, stating that they did not need outsiders to deal with their problems, Ploopploopeen yelled at him that this was the only way.

The next day, Ploopploopeen lead [Dad](../pcs/dad.md), [Ebadius](../pcs/ebadius.md), [Groggle](../pcs/groggle.md), Sarith, [Eldeth](../party/eldeth.md), [Ront](../party/ront.md), Shuushar, [Buppido](../party/buppido.md), and [Stool](../party/stool.md) to the altar of the Deep Father to be sacrificed. He handed the party over to Bloppblippodd, who then began to conduct the ritual. Ploopploopeen interrupted the ritual by killing Bloppblippodd and commanding the party, and his disciples, to attack.

When Demogorgon rose from the water, Ploopploopeen remained silent, watching the chaos unfold. He was last seen standing at the altar as the party escaped and Demogorgon attacked.

## Possible Death and Legacy
While his death was not witnessed, due to the destruction of Sloobludop it is suspected that Ploopploopeen was killed amidst the chaos. When the party returned to Sloobludop to salvage parts of the wreckage to make a boat, his body was not recovered. The party did discover a select group of kuo-toa continuing to worhship the Deep Father, so it is assumed that the onlt remaining kuo-toa within the town are members of the cult.

Shuushar remained the only party member to discuss Ploopploopeen, seemingly because of their close connection.

## Relationships
Ploopploopeen was generally respected amongst the other kuo-toa due to his status. He had a positive relationship with Shuushar, as the two of them shared a history together. It is unclear how his relationship with his son Glogglugogg was, since the only interaction seen between them involved Ploopploopeen yelling at him. It is unknown what his relationship with Bloppblippodd was before the schism began, but their relationship ended on extremely negative terms.

## Trivia
* Ploopploopeen followed kuo-toa customs to a fault. He always felt the need to be standing above those he was speaking to, even if it was of inqonsequential susbstance. He would have no qualms grabbing items from nearby shops to stand on as necessary.
