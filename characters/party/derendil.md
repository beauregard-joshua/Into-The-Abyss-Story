# Derendil

![Derendil](Derendil.png)

Derendil was a male quaggoth encountered as a prisoner of Velkenvelve.

## Personality
Derendil was very polite, much to the surprise of the other party members, due to the nature of quaggoths.

## Background
Little is known about Hemeth's background. He mentioned to the party that he was a merchant who tried selling to both sides of the Sloobludop schism, but was eventually caught, which was likely how he ended up as a sacrifice.

## Story
### [Travel to Sloobludop](../../sessions/arc02/info.md)
Hemeth was first met in Sloobludop as a potential sacrifice to Leemooggoogoon at the cult of the Deep Father. He was chained to the altar and was beaten and nearly unconscious, but was just barely able to speak with the party when they spoke to him. He did not know where he was or what was going on. After Demogorgon rose from the Darklake, [Ebadius](../pcs/ebadius.md) attempted to pull Hemeth free from his chains, but [Alias](../pcs/alias.md) stepped in and picked the lock and they escaped. [Sarith](sarith.md) took Hemeth into the tunnels to escape and they eventually me up with the rest of the party.

### [???](../../sessions/arc03/info.md)
As the party went looking for food, Hemeth stayed behind at base camp with [Groggle](../pcs/groggle.md) and [Shuushar](shuushar.md) while others looked for food. Eventually he was left alone with Eldeth as others went to explore Sloobludop. When [Dad](../pcs/dad.md) and Sarith arrived and alerted them to the drow, they rushed off to Sloobludop to warn the others. Hemeth helped build their boat and was declared captain of the vessel, since he would know how to get to Gracklstugh.

## Relationships
Hemeth has not established a particularly strong relationship with anyone thus far, but he has gained a little respect, likely because of his usefulness.
