# Ront

![Ront](Ront.png)

Ront is an orc who found his way into the underdark and into Velkenvelve prison. He has remained with the party since arriving in the prison and has been a useful force in combat.

## Personality

As with most other orcs, Ront is aggressive and dim-witted. His primary language as orcish makes his spoken common appear clumsy and broken, adding to his slow persona. He is often quick to anger, which has proven both detrimental and benificial depending on the circumstances, and puts a strong importance on physical strength. He has often made decision or comments based on his needs or the needs of the strong over the needs of the party; that said, Ront does appear to have the party's best interests at heart much of the time.

One of Ront's major personality traits is his arrogance and the actions he takes to demonstrate his performance. He is often one of the first members of the party to begin an encounter and has no problem with rushing in head first to do some damage to his enemy. This lack of sense of danger has lead him to danger many times while simultaneously protecting the party. In one instance, Ront tested some suspicious water before the others had and was inadvertantly poisoned. Another time Ront attacked a rampaging giant in Gracklstugh, and was nearly killed in the process. His arrogance also appeared when he stepped up in an attempt to be made captain of the party's boat on the darklake, and no one else voted for him.

## Background

Ront comes from the Iceshield tribe of orcs on the surface. He mentioned that his tribe was at war, but made no mention as to who it was with, possibly because he himself does not know. Ront found his way into the underdark by falling into a hole and wandering into a drow patrol, leading him to Velkenvelve. Not much else is known about Ront's past.

## Story
### [The Prison at Velkenvelve](../../sessions/arc01/info.md)

Ront first arrived at Velkvenvelve together with [Derendil](derendil.md). On arrival Ront pressed his personality forward and tried to intimidate several of the others, specifically [Stool](stool.md) and [Shuushar](shuushar.md). Other party members such as [Dad](../pcs/dad.md) and [Eldeth](eldeth.md) moved to stop his aggressive behavior, and Ront quickly settled down. He remained mostly quiet during discussions of escape, having very little to offer in terms of ideas or solutions.

When the second riot in Velkenvelve began, Ront was on duty cleaning the mess hall with [Buppido](buppido.md) and Derendil. He and Derendil leave the mess hall to see the commotion, and both begin to join the fight. Ront held off several drow and quaggoths for a time while Dad got the elevator working. Once the elevator arrived, Ront escaped with Dad and Eldeth, leaving Derendil behind.

After escaping Velkenvelve, Ront voted to travel to Gracklstugh, citing that it seemed like a strong and safe place to go.

### [Travel to Sloobludop](../../sessions/arc02/info.md)

While traveling to Sloobludop, Ront often took position at the front of the party in case of an attack. He was often walking alongside Dad so that the two of them would be able to fight together.

When the party discovered the lost city of Alversin, Ront responded to Shuushar's screaming in the street, discovering the "rocktopus". Ront and Dad together were able to kill the rocktopus and cut it up into slabs of meat for rations. He spent most of his time in the city beside Dad while searching for supplies.

In the tunnels with the goblins, Ront voted to attack the goblins while they slept. When combat began, Ront did not hestiate to start attacking, even with the apprehension of the other party members.

When [Jimjar's](jimjar.md) body was discovered in the cavern, Ront immedietely began screaming. He did not make any direct accusations toward anyone, but instead generally listened to the loudest person at the time. He went to sleep assuming that everything was okay and no one was there to harm him. At some point in the night, Ront awoke to steal Jimjar's body, likely during his watch, and ate a portion of his body.

In the fight with the Gas Spores, Ront beat one of the creatures to death with his fists, but sustained critical damage from the combat. He later drank the water running through the cavern, noting his foul taste, leading the party to suspect that it had been poisoned. [Groggle](../pcs/groggle.md) later healed Ront both of his injuries as well as of the suspected poison.

On several night watches, Ront was grouped with Dad and Stool, with the rationale being that Dad would level Ront's head and Stool would not antagonize him. On one of the nights, Ront asked if he could eat Stool, but Dad convinced him not to.

Ront came to join the attack against the kuo-toa of the [cult of the Deep Father](../../lore/organizations/deepfather.md), but conflict swiftly ended. Ront did not seriously consider the proposal from [Ploopploopeen](../sloobludop/ploopploopeen.md), but instead followed along with the others and chose to aid him in his request.

When [Demogorgon](../../lore/demon_lords/demogorgon.md) emerged from the darklake during the ritual at the [cult of the Deep Father](../../lore/organizations/deepfather.md), Ront was paralyzed in fear from the demon lord's madness. Shuushar was able to snap Ront out of his stupor and led him out of the city. Ront and Shuushar arrived in the tunnels just after Dad and Eldeth. He remained very quiet afterward, presumably as a consequence of the madness of Demogorgon.

### [Dangers of the Darklake](../../sessions/arc03/info.md)

As the party went to search for supplies in the wreckage of Sloobludop, Ront stayed behind in the tunnels with Dad and [Sarith](sarith.md) in order to search for food. The group was found by a drow scout party, and Ront ran into the tunnels and got separated from both Dad and Sarith. Ront eventually found his way back to the camp as the party was preparing to leave for Sloobludop, catching them just in time.

When the party was first attacked by an aquatic troll on the darklake, Ront was severely damaged in combat, along with Dad and Sarith. He also damaged the boat quite a bit from missed attacks. When the party docked to gather supplies and repair the boat, Ront stayed behind to rest and recover.

When the party attacked the duergar traders on the darklake, Ront follows along with Dad and tries to combat the traders. When Dad jumped over to their boat, Ront attempted to follow, but accidentally fell into the lake and had to be pulled back into the boat.

Ront investigated the second hag in the darklake along with Dad and Alias. As the party was suspicious, Ront did not attempt to negotiate, and instead bit the hag's neck and then snapped her neck. He ate a portion of the hag's body afterward. He again stayed behind in order to rest and eat.

When the party started a mutiny on the ship against [Hemeth](hemeth.md), several party members were selected as possible captains and first mates. Ront stood up and stated that he would be the captain, and no one else voted for him.

After docking again, Dad and Ront searched the tunnels for food. They eventually joined up with [Ebadius](../pcs/ebadius.md) and Sarith, who was tied and bound, and found a large collection of new edible fungi. Ront helped to carry all of the food back with them. They meet back up with Groggle and Eldeth and return to the boat.

### [The City of Blades](../../sessions/arc04/info.md)

In the march to Gholbrorn's Lair in Gracklstugh, Ront was sent first, since the party did not trust him and wanted him to get to safety as quickly as possible. Unable to communicate with the tavern dwellers, Ront tried to spend time with Dad in the tavern instead of gathering information with Groggle, Ebadius, and others.

When the two-headed giant attacked the city, Ront joined the fight with most of the party. He got caught underneath the feet of the giant and was nearly crushed to death. Groggle healed him afterward, but Ront's personality was radically shifted afterward. He returned to the inn by himself and is consoled by Dad, although Ront expressed deep feeling of fear for the first time on their entire adventure. Dad attempts to lift his spirits by convincing him to start an arm-wrestling side-hustle in the city, which leads Ront to being apprehended by Errde Blackskull and taken to Overlake Hold. After being taken, he joined Eldeth with Gartokkar Xundorn to meet Themberchaud, further lowering his mood.

After leaving Themberchaud's Lair, Ront split up with Eldeth and Dad. Dad saw Ront wade into the waters of the darklake to wash himself off.

## Relationships

Ront's strongest relationship by far is with Dad, the half-orc, who appreciates his strength and tenacity. The two of them often go off on adventures by themselves, and they have each mentioned in the past about how they will not leave each other behind. Ront has confided in Dad on several occasions when the journey got difficult; this revealed Dad's general inability to comfort others, as Ront was never really made to feel better.

Some of Ront's party members have a fear of him. This is generally caused by his aggressive nature, including events such as him eating Jimjar and asking if he could eat Stool. While he inspired fear in some, others simply found his behaviors irritating. Sarith and Eldeth have expressed discontent regarding how Ront acts and how he cannot be trusted, while others have come to his defense, since he is usually not aggressive out of malice but instead out of ignorance. There are some, such as Ebadius and Alias, that view Ront more as a tool for survival than as a party member.

## Trivia
* Ront is the party member that has been on the cusp of death the most times. Ront has been poisoned and beaten to near death on several occassions, and each time he has a bit of a personality shift afterward that makes him act a bit more hesitantly.
