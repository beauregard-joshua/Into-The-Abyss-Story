![Sarith](Sarith.png)

Sarith Kzekarit is a male drow first met as a prisoner in Velkenvelve and has remained with the party every since. While suffering from an unknown condition, he has acted as a great source of information and resources for the party and has been very useful for survival.

## Personality
Unlike most people from the underdark, Sarith acts calm, collected, and level headed in most situations. He mixes his opinions and actions from traditional drow culture as well as with a pragmatic view of the situation. He has often demonstrated rational decision making even when the party is under severe distress.

Sarith suffers from an unknown condition that sometimes adjusts his personality. While normally calm and collected, when his infection takes control Sarith becomes unreasonable and aggressive. He has shown violence toward his fellow party members, although he appears to return to his standard personality after some time. His pragmatism in this matter has led to him suggesting that the party leave him in the underdark to fend for himself to not be a danger to others, but his relationships with the others of his party prevented anyone from wanted to leave him, save for [Eldeth](eldeth.md).

## Background
Sarith is a drow of the underdark that has spent his life living the ways of the drow. He was a soldier in some regard before being imprisoned in Velkenvelve, but it is unknown his rank or who he worked for. It is assumed that his combat skill originates from his days as a soldier, which he has demonstrated numerous times. This can also be seen through his classical use of the two-bladed techniques commonly used by drow soldiers. Regarding drow culture, Sarith has been a useful resource for explaining customs and behaviours, suggesting the fact that he has been raised in accordance with these customs.

Sarith at some point contracted an unknown fungal infection that has spread across his face. It is unknown if he attempted to treat this infection at any point, but current treatments that the party has attmepted have not made an effect.

## Story
### [The Prison at Velkenvelve](../../sessions/arc01/info.md)

Sarith was one of the first arrivals to Velkenvelve prison, along with [Ebadius](../pcs/ebadius.md) and [Groggle](../pcs/groggle.md). He explained to the two of them the basics of drow prison camps, what to expect, and otherwise kept to himself. After the arrival of others and the party was split into performing menial tasks, Sarith was organized with Ebadius and Groggle and tasked with stacking rocks, and is later taken away to wash clothing. Sarith was complicit with these instructions for the fact that, as he explained, fighting against the drow was likely a lost cause.

When the first revolt at Velkenvelve began, Sarith seized the opportunity to have [Alias](../pcs/alias.md) and Groggle jump to the webbing below. He eventually surrendered to the drow and was taken back to the cell along with Groggle.

Sarith started the second revolt at Velkenvelve by throwing a rock at a nearby guard while screeching. This caused [Dad](../pcs/dad.md) to scream "anarchy" and motivate [Ront](ront.md) and Eldeth into rioting as well. During the combat Sarith is restrained by the guards while the others continued to fight, eventually causing the party to lose track of him. Sarith eventually caught up to the party right before one of the drow guards arrived to deliver supplies and returning to the prison.

In the vote for where to travel next, Sarith voted for Neverlight Grove, citing its peace and likely means to the surface.

### [Travel to Sloobludop](../../sessions/arc02/info.md)

In the initial travel away from Velkenvelve toward Sloobludop, Sarith provided useful information about the underdark to aid their travel. Sarith helped find edible fungus along the walls and taught the party which fungi to avoid. When the party first encountered a glowing bubble in a corridor, Sarith informed everyone that it was *faerzress* and contains magical properties. As the cavern opened up, he let the party know that they were approaching the lost city of Alversin, which could serve as a good base of operations and location to look for supplies.

Sarith opened up to a few members of the party during their first watch together. Sarith mentioned to Ebadius that he was uncertain of [Buppido](buppido.md) and thought everyone should keep eyes on him at all times. The next day he urges the party to continue moving along for fear of pursuit by the drow, but is only able to motivate Buppido and [Jimjar](jimjar.md). He waited with them before the others arrived and eagerly urged everyone to leave.

When the party encountered a group of goblins in the tunnels, Sarith tried to steer the party to avoid them. When conflict began, Sarith attacked in an attempt to silence them.

When Jimjar was found dead, Sarith expressed extreme distrust of everyone in the party. Dad attempted to intimidate Sarith to get a confession out of him, which only made Sarith angrier and nearly started a brawl. When the party went back to sleep Sarith stayed awake. When told by Groggle that he did not need to stay awake, he stated that there was no one there that he trusted, so he would stay awake the entire time.

On the next night on watch, Alias was on watch with Sarith. Sarith evaded all of Alias' remarks due to his lack of trust in her. The rest of the watch remained silent.

When the party camped for one night and were able to hear chatter in another chamber, Sarith stayed behind with Dad while the others investigated. Dad attempted to speak with Sarith, but he remained evasive. This started an altercation between Dad and Sarith, which needed to be broken up by Eldeth, and others assisted on return. After this, Groggle tried to health Sarith's fungal growth, which caused it to burn on his face and he screamed. Sarith was next on watch with Alias and [Shuushar](shuushar.md), but remained quiet.

Sarith awoke screaming and writhing, waking up the party. After being bound and held for quite some time he eventually passed out. After waking up, Ebadius explains the situation to him, and Sarith asked to remain bound since he is not trustworthy. His hands were unbound only to assist making bread from fungus for the evening, and went hungry for the night with Ebadius, Groggle, and Eldeth. Sarith remained bound during his watch with Alias and Eldeth, but was less resistant this time with conversation. He thanked the two for not assuming the worst in him.

Sarith remained bound for quite some time. Sarith was unable to assist the battle against the grell. After camping another night the party began to trust Sarith again and untied him.

Sarith assisted Alias, Ebadius, and Shuushar with scouting ahead when they encountered a band of kuo-toa. When Shuushar was abducted by them, Sarith sent Ebadius back to grab the others in the party while he remained on watch and kept close. He moved in to attack the kuo-toa when the archpriest of the Sea Mother [Ploopploopeen](../sloobludop/ploopploopeen.md) arrived and aided in the fight.

When the party reached Sloobludop, Sarith went to his room and remained there all day to rest. He was not seen by anyone until the following day.

Sarith borrowed some money from Groggle to buy himself a few supplies.

Sarith went along with the plan to infiltrate the [cult of the Deep Father](../../lore/organizations/deepfather.md). When [Demogorgon](../../lore/demon_lords/demogorgon.md) arose from the darklake, Sarith was driven into a temporary madness, but was broken free from it with Shuushar's aid. Sarith assisted [Hemeth](hemeth.md) in escaping from the altar, and the two of them were the first to escape from Sloobludop during the attack. Sarith rang the bell that he had purchased to get the attention of the fleeing party to gather in the tunnels. He backed the suggestion of moving away from Sloobludop to reach Gracklstugh, although reminded the party of Neverlight Grove, even without [Stool's](stool.md) help.

### [Dangers of the Darklake](../../sessions/arc03/info.md)

As the party splits up to gather materials to travel the darklake, Sarith travels with Dad and Ront to search for food when they encounter the Velkenvelve search party. Dad and Sarith together kill the drow on patrol and escape down a corridor, losing Ront in the process. They made their way back to camp when the following drow followed another corridor following a suspicious creature. He then traveled back to Sloobludop to join up with the party searching the salvage.

Together with Alias, Sarith distracted the searching drow party by having them investigate the kuo-toa that remained within the wrecked town.

When the boat was attacked by an aquatic troll, Sarith took considerable damage and was severely injured. He also fumbled during the fight and damaged the ship.

Sarith traveled into the tunnels of the underdark after docking the boat to search for salvage for repair along with Dad and Groggle. After repairing the boat he stayed behind with Ebadius while others went into the tunnels to look for food. Sarith held conversation with Ebadius, but acted strangely and spoke out of character from himself. Ebadius kept this information to himself and said nothing to Sarith about it. Later that night Ebadius saw Sarith behaving strangely again, seemingly speaking to himself and twitching.

As the party attacked the duregar traders, Sarith continuously asked what the party was doing and why this was the right move. He said nothing as they sailed away.

After docking for the second time, Sarith searches the tunnels for food with Alias, Dad, and Ebadius. After Dad headed back with food, Sarith heard noises coming from down the corridor. He returned to the boat with what food he had found and sent Dad and Groggle back to assist, claiming that their balance of skills would be adequate. As the party emerged victorious, Sarith suggested that they rest while the rest of them stood watch before heading out.

Sarith stayed behind when the party discovered the fungal island on the darklake. When the party returned in a hurry, Sarith began acting strangely again; he grabbed Groggle by his collar and attempted to throw him into the water while the others were prepping to leave. We was restrained by Ebadius and did little to try to resist until he passed out. When we awoke and had the situation explained to him, Sarith was defeated from the situation, and suggested that the party simply leave him behind as to not jeopardize their survival. Groggle stepped up and told him that they wouldn't leave him behind. He expresses gratitude for having friends like them, but assures them that they are making a mistake.

Searching more tunnels for food, Sarith, bound, traveled with Ebadius when they encountered a group of drow. Sarith convinced Ebadius to cut his bindings and he approached them to parlay safely. He learned that they were traders, bought soap from them, then returned to Ebadius to be bound once again. Ebadius chose not to bind Sarith again and the two returned to the boat.

Sarith explained the complicated situation in regards to docking in Gracklstugh and the issue that they may encounter. He was unsure whether to dock directly in the city or to approach on foot.

### [The City of Blades](../../sessions/arc04/info.md)

When the party made it to the inn in Gracklstugh, Sarith took a room with Shuushar and quickly fell asleep, similar to his arrival in Sloobludop. He slept through the entirety of the commotion regarding the rampaging giant. Alias went to his room to tell him what had happened and, appearing unphased, returned to sleep on the floor while Shuushar slept in the single bed.

The party lost track of Sarith while they brokered their deals with the [Stoneguard](../../lore/organizations/stoneguard.md) and the [Keepers of the Flame](../../lore/organizations/keepersofflame.md). While most of the party was gathering supplies and researching next steps, Alias and Groggle spend a large portion of time looking for him, but are unsuccessful. He was eventually spotted by Dad, Alias, and Groggle being dragged away to Overlake Hold. With a combined effort from Alias and Ebadius, the two are able to break him out of prison in an attempt to free themselves of the Stoneguard under the protection of the Keepers of the Flame. Sarith, smelling strongly of alcohol, was barely able to speak while the party explained their situation. As Shuushar arrived, Ebadius cast *invisibility* on Sarith to hide him and instructed Shuushar to keep him hidden.

## Relationships

Sarith has had mixed relationships all along the journey, not due to decision making but instead due to his personality switches. Much of the party puts stock in his ideas and combat abilities, but often keep him at a distance the moment something in his personality switches. It should be noted that even with his extreme swings in behavior most of the party has continued to support him. This is possibly due to his normally rational demeanor or the fact that he is vital to the partys survival.

Sarith has had moments to connect with quite a few party members. He has shown to have a very strong relationship with Alias, Ebadius, and Groggle individually. Groggle has expressed a strong interest in healing Sarith's infection, even to Sarith's refusal for treatment. While both Alias and Ebadius had their doubts about Sarith when Jimjar was found murdered, the two of them each individually had moments with him that led them to trust him in the end. Alias often finds herself scouting with Sarith, while Ebadius enjoys learning more about the underdark from him.

Dad and Sarith once shared a strained relationship, starting from the murder of Jimjar. Dad immedietely did not trust Sarith and threatened him on several occassions, causing Sarith to retaliate. This caused a rift in the party several times and pushed Sarith to even refusing to spend watch orders with Dad. Their relationship changed, however, after Demogorgon's attack on Sloobludop, when the two of them, along with Ront, survived in the tunnels together. From that point forward, Sarith and Dad held a strong relationship.

The only strong negative relationships that Sarith has are with Eldeth, due to her flagrant racism, and formerly with Hemeth, who was prepared to have him killed when he was temporarily voted as captain.

## Trivia
* Sarith has been both one of the most helpful party members as well as one of the most dangerous. Without his aid the party would have likely been unable to find or prepare food in the underdark or navigate some of the more complex tunnels. On the other hand, due to his personality switches he has harmed several party members and threatened their lives on multiple occassions.
* Sarith was originally one of the lead suspects for the murder of Jimjar, but most of the party came to his side once Dad threatened him.
* Alias and Ebadius both have had very deep conversations with Sarith, enough that their PCs made a note of the fact that they didn't expect to encounter someone so rational or down-to-earth in the underdark.
