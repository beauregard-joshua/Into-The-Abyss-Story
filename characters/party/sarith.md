![Sarith](Sarith.png)

Sarith Kzekarit is a male drow first met as a prisoner in Velkenvelve and has remained with the party every since. While suffering from an unknown condition, he has acted as a great source of information and resources for the party and has been very useful for survival.

## Personality
Unlike most people from the underdark, Sarith acts calm, collected, and level headed in most situations. He mixes his opinions and actions from traditional drow culture as well as with a pragmatic view of the situation. He has often demonstrated rational decision making even when the party is under severe distress.

Sarith suffers from an unknown condition that sometimes adjusts his personality. While normally calm and collected, when his infection takes control Sarith becomes unreasonable and aggressive. He has shown violence toward his fellow party members, although he appears to return to his standard personality after some time. His pragmatism in this matter has led to him suggesting that the party leave him in the underdark to fend for himself to not be a danger to others, but his relationships with the others of his party prevented anyone from wanted to leave him, save for [Eldeth](eldeth.md).

## Background
Sarith is a drow of the underdark that has spent his life living the ways of the drow. He was a soldier in some regard before being imprisoned in Velkenvelve, but it is unknown his rank or who he worked for. It is assumed that his combat skill originates from his days as a soldier, which he has demonstrated numerous times. This can also be seen through his classical use of the two-bladed techniques commonly used by drow soldiers. Regarding drow culture, Sarith has been a useful resource for explaining customs and behaviours, suggesting the fact that he has been raised in accordance with these customs.

Sarith at some point contracted an unknown fungal infection that has spread across his face. It is unknown if he attempted to treat this infection at any point, but current treatments that the party has attmepted have not made an effect.

## Story
### [The Prison at Velkenvelve](../../sessions/arc01/info.md)

Sarith was one of the first arrivals to Velkenvelve prison, along with [Ebadius](../pcs/ebadius.md) and [Groggle](../pcs/groggle.md). He explained to the two of them the basics of drow prison camps, what to expect, and otherwise kept to himself. After the arrival of others and the party was split into performing menial tasks, Sarith was organized with Ebadius and Groggle and tasked with stacking rocks, and is later taken away to wash clothing. Sarith was complicit with these instructions for the fact that, as he explained, fighting against the drow was likely a lost cause.

When the first revolt at Velkenvelve began, Sarith seized the opportunity to have [Alias](../pcs/alias.md) and Groggle jump to the webbing below. He eventually surrendered to the drow and was taken back to the cell along with Groggle.

Sarith started the second revolt at Velkenvelve by throwing a rock at a nearby guard while screeching. This caused [Dad](../pcs/dad.md) to scream "anarchy" and motivate [Ront](ront.md) and Eldeth into rioting as well. During the combat Sarith is restrained by the guards while the others continued to fight, eventually causing the party to lose track of him. Sarith eventually caught up to the party right before one of the drow guards arrived to deliver supplies and returning to the prison.

In the vote for where to travel next, Sarith voted for Neverlight Grove, citing its peace and likely means to the surface.

### [Travel to Sloobludop](../../sessions/arc02/info.md)

In the initial travel away from Velkenvelve toward Sloobludop, Sarith provided useful information about the underdark to aid their travel. Sarith helped find edible fungus along the walls and taught the party which fungi to avoid. When the party first encountered a glowing bubble in a corridor, Sarith informed everyone that it was *faerzress* and contains magical properties. As the cavern opened up, he let the party know that they were approaching the lost city of Alversin, which could serve as a good base of operations and location to look for supplies.

Sarith opened up to a few members of the party during their first watch together. Sarith mentioned to Ebadius that he was uncertain of [Buppido](buppido.md) and thought everyone should keep eyes on him at all times. The next day he urges the party to continue moving along for fear of pursuit by the drow, but is only able to motivate Buppido and [Jimjar](jimjar.md). He waited with them before the others arrived and eagerly urged everyone to leave.

When the party encountered a group of goblins in the tunnels, Sarith tried to steer the party to avoid them. When conflict began, Sarith attacked in an attempt to silence them.

When Jimjar was found dead, Sarith expressed extreme distrust of everyone in the party. Dad attempted to intimidate Sarith to get a confession out of him, which only made Sarith angrier and nearly started a brawl. When the party went back to sleep Sarith stayed awake. When told by Groggle that he did not need to stay awake, he stated that there was no one there that he trusted, so he would stay awake the entire time.

On the next night on watch, Alias was on watch with Sarith. Sarith evaded all of Alias' remarks due to his lack of trust in her. The rest of the watch remained silent.

When the party camped for one night and were able to hear chatter in another chamber, Sarith stayed behind with Dad while the others investigated. Dad attempted to speak with Sarith, but he remained evasive. This started an altercation between Dad and Sarith, which needed to be broken up by Eldeth, and others assisted on return. After this, Groggle tried to health Sarith's fungal growth, which caused it to burn on his face and he screamed. Sarith was next on watch with Alias and [Shuushar](shuushar.md), but remained quiet.

Sarith awoke screaming and writhing, waking up the party. After being bound and held for quite some time he eventually passed out. After waking up, Ebadius explains the situation to him, and Sarith asked to remain bound since he is not trustworthy. His hands were unbound only to assist making bread from fungus for the evening, and went hungry for the night with Ebadius, Groggle, and Eldeth. Sarith remained bound during his watch with Alias and Eldeth, but was less resistant this time with conversation. He thanked the two for not assuming the worst in him.

Sarith remained bound for quite some time. Sarith was unable to assist the battle against the grell. After camping another night the party began to trust Sarith again and untied him.

Sarith assisted Alias, Ebadius, and Shuushar with scouting ahead when they encountered a band of kuo-toa. When Shuushar was abducted by them, Sarith sent Ebadius back to grab the others in the party while he remained on watch and kept close. He moved in to attack the kuo-toa when the archpriest of the Sea Mother [Ploopploopeen](../sloobludop/ploopploopeen.md) arrived and aided in the fight.

When the party reached Sloobludop, Sarith went to his room and remained there all day to rest. He was not seen by anyone until the following day.

Sarith borrowed some money from Groggle to buy himself a few supplies.

Sarith went along with the plan to infiltrate the [cult of the Deep Father](../../lore/organizations/deepfather.md). When Demogorgon arose from the darklake, Sarith was driven into a temporary madness, but was broken free from it with Shuushar's aid. Sarith assisted [Hemeth](hemeth.md) in escaping from the altar, and the two of them were the first to escape from Sloobludop during the attack. Sarith rang the bell that he had purchased to get the attention of the fleeing party to gather in the tunnels. He backed the suggestion of moving away from Sloobludop to reach Gracklstugh, although reminded the party of Neverlight Grove, even without [Stool's](stool.md) help.

### [Dangers of the Darklake](../../sessions/arc03/info.md)

As the party splits up to gather materials to travel the darklake, Sarith travels with Dad and Ront to search for food when they encounter the Velkenvelve search party. Dad and Sarith together kill the drow on patrol and escape down a corridor, losing Ront in the process. They made their way back to camp when the following drow followed another corridor following a suspicious creature. He then traveled back to Sloobludop to join up with the party searching the salvage.

Together with Alias, Sarith distracted the searching drow party by having them investigate the kuo-toa that remained within the wrecked town.

When the boat was attacked by an aquatic troll, Sarith took considerable damage and was severely injured. He also fumbled during the fight and damaged the ship.
