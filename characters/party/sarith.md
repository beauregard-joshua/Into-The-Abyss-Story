Sarith Kzekarit is a male drow first met as a prisoner in Velkenvelve and has remained with the party every since. While suffering from an unknown condition, he has acted as a great source of information and resources for the party and has been very useful for survival.

## Personality
Unlike most people from the underdark, Sarith acts calm, collected, and level headed in most situations. He mixes his opinions and actions from traditional drow culture as well as with a pragmatic view of the situation. 

## Background
Sarith is a drow of the underdark that has spent his life living the ways of the drow. He was a soldier in some regard before being imprisoned in Velkenvelve, but it is unknown his rank or who he worked for. It is assumed that his combat skill originates from his days as a soldier, which he has demonstrated numerous times. This can also be seen through his classical use of the two-bladed techniques commonly used by drow soldiers. Regarding drow culture, Sarith has been a useful resource for explaining customs and behaviours, suggesting the fact that he has been raised in accordance with these customs.
