# Eldeth Feldrun

![Eldeth](Eldeth.png)

Eldeth Feldrun is a female dwarf from Gauntlgrym who found her way into the underdark. She was first encountered in Velkenvelve and has remained with the party every since.

## Personality
Eldeth is known amongst the party as being one of the more level-headed members, offering useful advice while remaining cautious as necessary. While she has not stood out as a primary leader, her calm demeaner does make her someone that others turn to for her input before a decision is made. On more than one occasion, the primary leaders of [Alias](../pcs/alias.md) and [Ebadius](../pcs/ebadius.md) have stopped discussion to ask Eldeth what she thinks. While she has suffered from the ill effects of madness on more than one occasion, she has remained a useful ally o the party.

Eldeth also has a strong will to fight when things get tough. She has often been toward the front of the party when combat begins and aids in leading the party when fighting is required. This trait of hers has also caused other party members to turn to her on several occasions, even causing her to bond with some of the more brutish party members like [Dad](../pcs/dad.md) and [Ront](ront.md).

Her most difficult trait is her flagrant racism towards the creatures of the underdark. She has referred to several underdark races as "darkies" and has made a few party members anrgy with her as a result. She had a difficult time trusting certain members such as [Sarith](sarith.md), especially after he exhibited his bouts of madness, and she especially did not trust [Buppido](buppido.md) when we was around. She has always stuck close to the surface dwwellers in the party, having more in common with them and harboring no resentment either.

## Background
Eldeth comes from the city of Gauntlgrym, and is the daughter of a noble of the city. She was raised as a traditional daughter of nobility and knows a lot of information regarding overworld history, politics, and kingdoms. She also has skills to reflect this upbringing, as well as combat skills demonstrated from being raised in a traditional dwarven household. This background has made Eldeth both a competent fighter as well as a value asset in decision making.

Little else is known about her history, as she doesn't much talk about the details.

## Story
### [The Prison at Velkenvelve](../../sessions/arc01/info.md)

Eldeth arrived in Velkenvelve alongside [Jimjar](jimjar.md) while the prisoners were performing their daily tasks. After the prisoners started their first commotion, Ebadius was returned to the cell and was the first to introduce himself to Eldeth. When the others returned from the commotion, Eldeth introduced herself to everyone, and most of the party quickly attached themselves to her since she seemed dependable. She did instill a bit of worry when she discussed the creatures of the underdark with disdain, but others mostly looked past these comments considering their situation. She infored the party of her valuables that were taken when she was detained and asked people to look for them if something were to happen to her, namely her hammer and her armor.

Eldeth was on duty with Dad and Sarith when Sarith threw a rock at a guard and Dad started a riot. Eldeth joined in the conflict to hold of the guards when [Derendil](derendil.md) and Ront joined the fight as well. Together, Eldeth was able to escape through the elevator with Dad and Ront before much else evolved. Eldeth waited for the party to arrive slowly and was unaware of the commotion of the mosters that had attacked at the same time. There, Alias returned her hammer to her, but her armor remained unrecovered.

When voting on where to travel next, Eldeth voted to travel to Sloobludop, thinking that it was best to find a safe haven and resupply themselves before seeking a way out of the underdark. She also trusted that [Shuushar](shuushar.md) would be able to navigate them there safely and could also navigate the darklake once there if needed.

### [Travel to Sloobludop](../../sessions/arc02/info.md)

Eldeth was placed mostly toward the front of the party due to ability in combat after leaving Velkenvelve.

As the party approached the large cavern with the lost city of Alversin, Eldeth began to fall into the early stages of madness after hearing the voices whispering around them. She was eventually calmed down by Alias and was able to keep moving, although shaken up. Within the city, she stayed close with Alias and Stool during their search

## Trivia
* Eldeth was a love interest of Alias for a long time before Eldeth had to confront her that she was not gay.
* Eldeth has a racist attitude toward many races of the underdark, reffering once to the drow as "the darkies". This appears to be the only really negative quality of Eldeth, and is often forgotten by the other party members.
