# Eldeth Feldrun

![Eldeth](Eldeth.png)

Eldeth Feldrun is a female dwarf from Gauntlgrym who found her way into the underdark. She was first encountered in Velkenvelve and has remained with the party every since.

## Personality
Eldeth is known amongst the party as being one of the more level-headed members, offering useful advice while remaining cautious as necessary. While she has not stod out as a primary leader, her calm demeaner does make her someone that others turn to for her input before a decision is made. On more than one occasion, the primary leaders of [Alias](../pcs/alias.md) and [Ebadius](../pcs/ebadius.md) have stopped discussion to ask Eldeth what she thinks. While she has suffered from the ill effects of madness on more than one occasion, she has remained a useful ally o the party.

Eldeth also has a strong will to fight when things get tough. She has often been toward the front of the party when combat begins and aids in leading the party when fighting is required. This trait of hers has also caused other party members to turn to her on several occasions, even causing her to bond with some of the more brutish party members like [Dad](../pcs/dad.md) and [Ront](ront.md).

Her most difficult trait is her flagrant racism towards the creatures of the underdark. She has referred to several underdark races as "darkies" and has made a few party members anrgy with her as a result. She had a difficult time trusting certain members such as [Sarith](sarith.md), especially after he exhibited his bouts of madness, and she especially did not trust [Buppido](buppido.md) when we was around. She has always stuck close to the surface dwwellers in the party, having more in common with them and harboring no resentment either.
