Shuushar is a male kuo-toa from Sloobludop first encountered in Velkenvelve.

## Personality
Shuushar may be best described as a pacifist and an optimist. He is never looking fro confrontation and always seeks a way to keep others in good spirits. This personality has lead to many issues throughout the adventure, as his attempt at good graces have often caused conflict with hostile opponents.
