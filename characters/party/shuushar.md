# Shuushar the Awakened

![Shuushar](Shuushar.png)

Shuushar is a male kuo-toa from Sloobludop first encountered in Velkenvelve.

## Personality
Shuushar may be best described as a pacifist and an optimist. He is never looking fro confrontation and always seeks a way to keep others in good spirits. This personality has lead to many issues throughout the adventure, as his attempt at good graces have often caused conflict with hostile opponents. He nevertheless tries to appease others and avoid violence whenever possible, which is difficult for him to do in the underdark.

His personality makes him quite agreeable at times, but others tend to heed the advice of more competent party members. For example, [Groggle](../pcs/groggle.md) has remained one of Shuushar's best companions, since the two of them are often of the mindset of trying to keep peace. His lack of desire for conflict, however, is also a rift that forms between himself as well as those that specialize in combat. This has caused numerous problems amonst party members, such as with [Ront](../party/ront.md) and [Hemeth](../party/hemeth.md), who often do not appreciate Shuushar's demeanor and approach to problem solving.

Even with others rejecting his ideas, Shuushar often keeps good spirits and views his party members as his friends, even if the feeling is not reciprocated.

## Background
Shuushar comes from the kuo-toa town of Sloobludop



## Trivia
* The name Shuushar *the Awakened* comes from the fact that he believes that he is an enlightened kuo-toa, although many in the party believe him simply to be naive.
* Shuushar has been extremely unlucky throughout the adventure. For example, Shuushar was abducted by his own kind to be taken to Sloobludop, and was also attacked while invisible by a fungus tree in the darklake. While he has not been the most useful party members, many in the party do believe that he is unluckier than most.
