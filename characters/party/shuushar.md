# Shuushar the Awakened

![Shuushar](Shuushar.png)

Shuushar is a male kuo-toa from Sloobludop first encountered in Velkenvelve.

## Personality
Shuushar may be best described as a pacifist and an optimist. He is never looking fro confrontation and always seeks a way to keep others in good spirits. This personality has lead to many issues throughout the adventure, as his attempt at good graces have often caused conflict with hostile opponents. He nevertheless tries to appease others and avoid violence whenever possible, which is difficult for him to do in the underdark.

His personality makes him quite agreeable at times, but others tend to heed the advice of more competent party members. For example, [Groggle](../pcs/groggle.md) has remained one of Shuushar's best companions, since the two of them are often of the mindset of trying to keep peace. His lack of desire for conflict, however, is also a rift that forms between himself as well as those that specialize in combat. This has caused numerous problems amonst party members, such as with [Ront](../party/ront.md) and [Hemeth](../party/hemeth.md), who often do not appreciate Shuushar's demeanor and approach to problem solving.

Even with others rejecting his ideas, Shuushar often keeps good spirits and views his party members as his friends, even if the feeling is not reciprocated.

## Background
Shuushar comes from the kuo-toa town of Sloobludop along the darklake in the underdark. His family, profession, or any other major lifestyle choices are largely unknown. While other kuo-toa are mostly insane, Shuushar stands out as an "enlightened" kuo-toa, aware of other cultures and not devout to the same gods. How he came to this position is also largely unknown.

It is known that Shuushar has some connections amongst important people in Sloobludop. He spoke with Ploopploopeen as if they had known each other for some time, and when exploring the town Shuushar spent time reconnecting with other kuo-toa that he knew. He was long ago known to be a follower of the sea mother Blibdoolpoolp, but has not expressed any devotion to gods during his time with the party.

## Story
### [The Prison at Velkenvelve](../../sessions/arc01/info.md)
Shuushar arrived at Velkenvelve together with [Stool](stool.md). While Stool hid in the corner, Shuushar swiftly introduced himself to the party, taking most note of [Alias](../pcs/alias.md) who spoke with him the most. He discussed how he was captured by drow while exploring outside of Sloobludop and how he is a pacifist, meaning that he did not resist capture. When discussing methods of escape, Shuushar often spoke like "good things would eventually happen", and had no real desire to fight back.

While planning an escape, Shuushar spent most of his time attempting to bond with the party, although many party members did not have much of a desire to speak with him. The one party member that he connected well with was Stool, who was also a pacifist, although that was mostly due to his age and fear.

When the prison break started, Shuushar was in the jail cell with most of the others. Led by [Ebadius](../pcs/ebadius.md) and Alias, Shuushar escaped with Groggle, [Jimjar](jimjar.md), Stool, [Topsy](topsy.md), and [Turvy](turvy.md) into the armory. While others fought, Shuushar helped Jimjar bar the back door. When Alias threw supplies down for others to use, Shuushar helped pass tools around, but did not take anything for himself. While combat ensued with [Ilvara](../velkenvelve/ilvara.md) and the demons, Shuushar stayed back as expected. Once many of the others left the armory, Shuushar jumped down from the armory and then into the pool of water beneath the waterfall, joined by Groggle, Jimjar, and Stool.

After escaping, Shuushar voted to travel to Sloobludop, since it was his hometown, he knew the route, and it was the closest location to them.

## Trivia
* The name Shuushar *the Awakened* comes from the fact that he believes that he is an enlightened kuo-toa, although many in the party believe him simply to be naive.
* Shuushar has been extremely unlucky throughout the adventure. For example, Shuushar was abducted by his own kind to be taken to Sloobludop, and was also attacked while invisible by a fungus tree in the darklake. While he has not been the most useful party members, many in the party do believe that he is unluckier than most.
