# Jimjar

![Jimjar](Jimjar.png)

Jimjar was a male deep gnome that joined the party in Velkenvelve. He was with the party from its time in Velkenvelve until his death in the tunnels of the Underdark.

## Personality
Jimjar was a friendly personality, who was somewhat talkative when he first met the others but soon became quiet once their lives were in danger. He talked with a very annoying voice that other members were bothered by. He didn't have much of an issue with other prisoners, trying to bond with many of them over the course of their stay.

Once freed from Velkenvelve, Jimjar's deeper personality came out, showing him to be afraid of most enemies and forms of combat. He was willing to participate in any way that he could, however, even going so far as to making the first strike when fighting a few goblins in the tunnels. While he was not particularly strong or overly charismatic, he was always eager to help.

It appeared that Jimjar liked gambling, for he often made bets with party members without having any money himself to pay with.

## Background
Little is known about Jimjar's background. He mentioned that he was from Blingdenstone, and was the only member of the party to vote to travel to Blingdenstone after escaping Velkenvelve. He made slight allusions to having a shady history, but not much else is known.

## Story
### [The Prison at Velkenvelve](../../sessions/arc01/info.md)
Jimjar arrived in Velkenvelve with [Eldeth](eldeth.md) during the combat that had occured within the first few days of prisoners arriving. [Ebadius](../pcs/ebadius.md) was returned to the cell, where he convinced Jimjar to run into the prison gate in order to open it. After two attempts, he dislocated his shoulder, and when others arrived, [Sarith](sarith.md) and [Alias](alias.md) helped relocate his shoulder.

During their plans to escape from Velkenvelve, Jimjar had little to offer in the way of assistance and little to say about his history, appearing somewhat evasive on the subject. He was placed on chore duty several times with some of the other prisoners.

As the great prison break at Velkenvelve started, Jimjar was in the cell with most of the others. He stayed toward the back of the pack with [Topsy](topsy.md) and [Turvy](turvy.md), mostly attempting to avoid conflict. After Alias threw weapons down for others to use, Jimjar grabbed a weapon, but was a bit reluctant to use it. He also narrowly avoided damage from Ilvara as she cast a *locust swarm*. Eventually he jumped down into the water together with [Groggle](../pcs/groggle.md) and [Shuushar](shuushar.md).

After escaping, Jimjar was one of the few party members to vote to travel to Blingdenstone, since it would take him home.

### [Travel to Sloobludop](../../sessions/arc02/info.md)
Jimjar traveled often at the middle of the pack when traversing the Underdark, as he was not well equipped for scouting ahead or defending the rear. In the lost city of Alversin, Jimjar explored a bit with Sarith but was unable to recover many materials. When Sarith grew impatient about leaving, Jimjar was one of the only people to join him at the rear of town, ready to leave.

When the party encountered a group of sleeping goblins in the tunnels, Jimjar was the first to strike, actually dealing substantial damage to one of them.

## Death and Legacy
Jimjar was found stabbed to death in a secluded tunnel of the Underdark while Alias and Eldeth were on watch. He was presumably killed in his sleep and apparently made no sound as he died. The killer has yet to be found, although the party remains suspicious of each other. He left little in the way of a lgeacy besides this suspicion, since he had not particularly bonded with any of the party members deeply. The night after he was murdered, it was discovered that Ront had started eating Jimjar's limbs out of hunger and survival.

After his death, Jimjar was mostly forgotten. Some of the paty members such as Eldeth were not fans of him, although that was primarily because of prejudice towards his race.

## Relationships
Jimjar had not been particularly close with any single member of the party. He mostly kept to himself and only spoke when he thought he had something clever to say. He had a bad relationship with Eldeth, who was prejudice against him, as well as Buppido, who he simply did not trust. After his rocky start with Ebadius, their relationship never really rekindled. By the end, his best relationship was either with Shuushar, who had always been friendly to him, or with Alias, who was somewhat using Jimjar just to have another party member act in defense.

## Trivia
* Jimjar had a voice akin to *Jarjar Binx* from the movie franchsie *Star Wars*. This made it so the party found listening to him quite annoying.
* [Dad](../pcs/dad.md) once made a bet with Jimjar that he could hit a stalagtite with a rock and succeeded, meaning that Jimjar owed Dad 5 gold pieces. This debt was never paid.
