# Hemeth

<img src="Hemeth.jpg" width="300px">

Hemeth is a male duergar merchant from Gracklstugh, first met in Sloobludop.

## Personality
Hemeth is blunt and to the point, much like other grey dwarves. He does not use flair in his language and instead speaks and acts directly in order to get a job done. When presented with difficult decisions, he often prompts the party with the options available, rather than beating around about the possibilities.

## Background
Little is known about Hemeth's background. He mentioned to the party that he was a merchant who tried selling to both sides of the Sloobludop schism, but was eventually caught, which was likely how he ended up as a sacrifice. It is also known that he comes from Gracklstugh, and suggests that the party seek refuge there.

## Story
### [Travel to Sloobludop](../../sessions/arc02/info.md)
Hemeth was first met in Sloobludop as a potential sacrifice to Leemooggoogoon at the cult of the Deep Father. He was chained to the altar and was beaten and nearly unconscious, but was just barely able to speak with the party when they spoke to him. He did not know where he was or what was going on. After Demogorgon rose from the Darklake, [Ebadius](../pcs/ebadius.md) attempted to pull Hemeth free from his chains, but [Alias](../pcs/alias.md) stepped in and picked the lock and they escaped. [Sarith](sarith.md) took Hemeth into the tunnels to escape and they eventually me up with the rest of the party.

### [???](../../sessions/arc03/info.md)
As the party went looking for food, Hemeth stayed behind at base camp with [Groggle](../pcs/groggle.md) and [Shuushar](shuushar.md) while others looked for food. Eventually he was left alone with Eldeth as others went to explore Sloobludop. When [Dad](../pcs/dad.md) and Sarith arrived and alerted them to the drow, they rushed off to Sloobludop to warn the others. Hemeth helped build their boat and was declared captain of the vessel, since he would know how to get to Gracklstugh.

While captaining the boat, Hemeth admitted to Alias that he had gotten them lost, but knew that he was headed in the direction of Gracklstugh. He brough this up in as blunt of a manner as possible.

When the boat was in danger, Hemeth did little to aid in the combat or the rowing, since he was navigating, and instead informed the party of the dangers and the possible solutions.

## Relationships
Hemeth has not established a particularly strong relationship with anyone thus far, but he has gained a little respect, likely because of his usefulness. Some party members value his opinions while others see him as a new member of the party whose opinion is not yet relevant.

## Trivia
* When Hemeth spoke up about where the party should travel, Dad interjected and mentioned that Hemeth shouldn't be listened to because he wasn't a member of the original party. This is made even stranger when Hemeth was made captian of their ship.
