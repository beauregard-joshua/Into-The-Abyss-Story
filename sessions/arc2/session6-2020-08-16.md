# Session 6: A Murderer Amongst Us (2020-08-16)
* The drow arrive in search of the party
    * Alias whiffs a rock and attracts the attention of a drow toward him and Eldeth
    * One drow spots Stool, then Buppido, then Gorggle casts suggestion and turns the drow away
    * The remaining drow find the corpses of the goblins and get distracted and the party escapes
* The party finds shelter and water
* Jimjar was found dead on Eldeth and Alias' watch
    * The murder weapon is presumably Jimjar's weapon, found amongst some rocks
    * Alias tries a gambit to trick the others into telling the truth, but it doesn't work
    * Sarith no longer trusts anyone
    * Dad intimidates Sarith, which makes many other party members distrust Dad
* The party begins traveling as normal
* The party encounters a fungus cavern and Alias finds Gas Spores
    * Ebadius slaughters two of them with a Scorching Ray
    * Ront punches one to death and suffers greatly
    * Dad kills one using a rock
* **The session ends before resolving the end of the combat**

## Trivia
* Groggle got the party experience for successfully steering the drow away, which was not what Josh was expecting.
* Several party memebers, such as Alias and Ebadius, do not trust Dad after his stunt with Sarith. Oddly enough their PCs have different thoughts. For example, Ebadius does not trust Dad, but Nick does not trust Mark.
