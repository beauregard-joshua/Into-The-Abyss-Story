# Session 4: Into the Underdark (2020-07-12)
* The party leaves Velkenvelve
    * The party consists of [Dad](../../characters/pcs/dad.md), Groggle, Ebadius, Alias, Sarith, Buppido, Eldeth, Jimjar, Shuushar, Stool, and Ront
    * Shuushar begins guiding the party on the way to the Kuo-Toan city of Sloobludop
* The party travels into a dark chamber that is difficult to navigate
    * The party staggers their approach through the cave to keep a relay system
    * Sarith identifies a glowing light as *faerzress*, which acts as a soft light and a protection from magic and divination
    * Dad and Eldeth descend into madness but Alias keeps them calm
    * The party arrives as the abandoned city of Alversin (as identified by Sarith)
* The party explores the first few blocks of the city, finding a few supplies, then going to sleep
    * A clever watch order is designed in which some members connect
    * Alias bonds with Eldeth, Alias continues tricking Dad, and Sarith discusses his apprehension of Buppido with Ebadius
* The party explores the rest of the city for much of the next day
    * ???
    * Shuushar finds a "rocktopus", Stool runs away, and Dad and Ront kill it
    * Alias, Eldeth, and Stool search for a key and some extra vials
    * Dad and Ront cut up the "rocktopus" for food
    * Ebadius, Groggle, and Shuushar explore the spooky castle and get spooked
* **The session ends with Ebadius, Goggle, and Shuushar exploring the castle for supplies**

## Trivia
* The big debate that several party members have here is whether to stay and look for supplies or run and stay ahead of any searching drow from Velkenvelve. Sarith appears to be the most impatient and wants to move as quickly as possible.
