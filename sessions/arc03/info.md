# Arc 3: Dangers of the Darklake

The party accidentally summons Demogorgon, who remains loose in
the Underdark. They search for a means to travel to Neverlight
Grove, which leads them to the Darklake. Traversing the darklake
proves dangerous as the party encounters an aquatic troll and
several darkmantles. Alias gets her sanity shaken in the tunnels
and the party attacks a duergar trade ship on the darklake after
attempting to negotiate.
