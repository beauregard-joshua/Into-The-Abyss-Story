[Home](../../README.md) > [Sessions](../info.md) > [Arc 3](info.md) > Session 15

* [Alias](../../characters/pcs/alias.md), [Dad](../../characters/dad.md), [Ebadius](../../characters/ebadius.md), and [Groggle](../../characters/groggle.md) scout ahead to search for any more gnolls
* Alias scouts the tunnel and finds a large pack of gnolls and returns to the party to develop a plan
* One of the previous gnolls wakes up and Dad kills him
* The party decides to have Dad attack the front with Ebadius and Groggle as support, while Alias sneaks behind and tries to assassinate the larger gnoll
* Dad attacks in a rage and the gnolls are not surprised
* The pack leader turns back and gravely wounds Alias, but she is able to deal moderate damage while Groggle heals her
* Groggle gives supporting fire while healing all the other party members
* The pack leader attacks Alias, then Groggle, then Ebadius, who finally kills him
* Dad nearly single-handedly kills 8 gnolls while in a rage
* The party loots the camp before leaving for the boat
* The remaining party members defend the combatents as they rest
* **The session ends with the party gearing up for traversing the darklake again**

## Trivia
* Dad nearly defeated every gnoll in the combat, by going into a rage and tanking all of their attacks. He only required healing once, and dealt the most damage in total.
* Mark thought that he was not proficient with the longbow he had retrieved from the gnoll pack lord, but successfully fired an arrow and hit a target. After remembering he was proficient, every arrow he fired since missed.
* Dad had performed several kills with such skill that he was able to cut through the gnoll's bodies in unique ways. For example, he sliced his axe through the gnoll's neck so quickly that his head spun around.
