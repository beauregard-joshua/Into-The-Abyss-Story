# Session 16: I'm Not Okay (2021-03-06)
* The party sets sail on the darklake
* [Groggle](../../characters/pcs/groggle.md) identifies an island and the party votes to explore it
* [Ebadius](../../characters/pcs/ebadius.md) casts *invisibility* on [Shuushar](../../character/party/shuushar.md) and sends him to explore the island
    * Shuushar makes a yelping sound like something is wrong
    * [Alias](../../characters/pcs/alias.md) runs to the rescue and then follows [Dad](../../characters/pcs/dad.md), Ebadius, Groggle, and [Eldeth](../../characters/pcs/eldeth.md)
    * The party finds Shuushar suffocating from the arm of a mushroom
    * Ebadius fires at the arm and Dad cuts it down
    * Groggle heals Shuushar
* The party discovers a note regarding the demon lord Zuggtmoy
* The party escapes the island
    * Ebadius casts *thaumaturgy* and provokes arms to attack from the ground
    * Dad and Alias stop Ebadius from turning back to face the fungi
    * Groggle, Eldeth, and Shuushar run straight back to the boat, with the others eventually behind
* [Sarith](../../characters/party/sarith.md) grabs Groggle and lifts him up, and Ebadius restrains him
* After sailing away Sarith wakes up and is defeated from the situation
* Alias begins hallucinating [Buppido](../../characters/party/buppido.md)
* **The session ends with the party worrying about how to deal with Sarith**

## Trivia
* The party immediately made a note of how unlucky Shuushar has been this whole adventure. This was further justified when Shuushar encountered being choked by the fungus.
