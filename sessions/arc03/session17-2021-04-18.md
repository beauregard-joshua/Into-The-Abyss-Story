# Session 17: I Am the Captain Now (2021-04-18)
* A debate ensues as to what to do with [Sarith](../../characters/party/sarith.md) and who should be captain
    * [Alias](../../characters/pcs/alias.md) and [Ebadius](../../characters/ebadius.md) stage a coup against [Hemeth](../../characters/party/hemeth.md)
    * Ebadius and [Dad](../../pcs/dad.md) restrain Hemeth while Alias winks at him
    * The party elects Alias as the new captain of the ship, with [Shuushar](../../party/shuushar.md) as the first mate
* Shuushar "steers" the party away from falling debris in the tunnels
* The party docks on land to look for food in the tunnels
    * [Eldeth](../../party/eldeth.md) stays behind to watch over Hemeth while Shuushar looks for food in the darklake
    * Dad and [Ront](../../party/ront.md) find new leathery fungus, then find some bluecaps before returning to the boat
    * Ebadius and a bound Sarith find some bluecaps as well as firestalk before returning to the boat
    * Alias and [Groggle](../../pcs/groggle.md) find a crystal cavern and encounter an injured dwarf
    * Groggle heals the dwarf who introduces himself as Gramel, who further explains he was attacked by a female drow and left to die
    * Gramel gives Groggle and Alias directions to Gracklstugh and some food, then they leave for the boat
* The party decides to gather food and crystals before leaving
    * Alias stays behind with Hemeth and Shuushar arrives with a few waterorbs
    * Groggle and Eldeth collect crystals and Groggle tests using them as weapons
    * Dad, Ebadius, Ront, and bound Sarith gather a large collection of food from the tunnels before encountering drow traders
    * Ebadius temporarily unbinds Sarith to have a conversation and buys soap from the merchants
    * The merchants pass by Groggle and Eldeth
* **The session ends with the party ready to return to the boat**

## Trivia
* Ront stood up in an attempt to vote himself captain of the ship. No one but Ront voted for him.
* Many party members (as well as the PCs) have expressed disdain for Shuushar, but the vote was nearly unanimous to have him as the first mate. It should be noted, however, that some members like Alias voted for Shuushar due to the ease of taking command from him if necessary.
