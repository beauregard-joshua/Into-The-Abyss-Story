* Alias, Dad, [Ebadius](../../characters/pcs/ebadius.md), and [Sarith](../../characters/party/sarith.md) look for food in the tunnels, while [Groggle](../../characters/pcs/groggle.md), [Shuushar](../../characters/party/shuushar.md), [Eldeth](../../characters/party/eldeth.md), Ront, and Hemeth stay behind
