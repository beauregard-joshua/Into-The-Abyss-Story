[Home](../../README.md) > [Sessions](../info.md) > [Arc 3](info.md) > Session 18

* **Note: the session started late due to a fight at Trader Joe's that made Mark late**
* [Dad](../../characters/pcs/dad.md), [Ebadius](../../characters/pcs/ebadius.md), [Sarith](../../characters/party/sarith.md), and [Ront](../../characters/party/ront.md) return to the crystal cavern with [Groggle](../../characters/pcs/groggle.md) and [Eldeth](../../characters/party/eldeth.md), then return to the boat
* Several days pass with no encounters along the darklake
* The party discusses the best method of entry into Gracklstugh
    * [Hemeth](../../characters/party/hemeth.md) lies to the party about the best means of entry and is caught by Dad and Sarith
    * Ebadius and [Alias](../../characters/pcs/alias.md) bring up the option of breaking into groups to reduce alerting the city of their arrival
    * Sarith explains how docking in the darklake would occur and the dangers the party could possibly face
* Alias, Groggle, and Eldeth begin smelling metallic fumes to indicate their approach of Gracklstugh
* **The session ends with the party approaching Gracklstugh by boat**

## Trivia
* This was a quick 2-hour session to fill some time that everyone had free, and so was a mostly uneventful day
