## Trivia
* Ebadius tried for a second time to investigate the Shattered Spire where he would be meeting Werz, but both times failed miserably to find anything.
* Ebadius tried to lie his way out of being caught by the stoneguard, but the guards had so much information on the team that this did nothing.
