# Session 19: Nobody Can See Sh\*t (2021-05-19)
* [Ebadius](../../characters/pcs/ebadius.md) casts *invisibility* on [Alias](../../characters/pcs/alias.md) so she can explore the gates of Gracklstugh
    * Alias knocks on the wall and then begins whisering ominously, getting shot by three bolts
    * The remainder of the party turns baack when [Shuushar](../../characters/party/shuushar.md) and [Eldeth](../../characters/party/eldeth.md) spot the bolts
* Alias returns to the boat and suggests docking at the docks
* [Groggle](../../characters/pcs/groggle.md) strikes a deal with [Hemeth](../../characters/party/hemeth.md) for aid in reaching the docks safely in exchange for giving the boat to Hemeth.
* Hemeth leads the party to the Gholbrorn's Lair in the order of [Ront](../../characters/party/ront.md), Shuushar, Eldeth, [Sarith](../../characters/party/sarith.md), Groggle, Ebadius, Alias, and [Dad](../../characters/pcs/dad.md)
* The party attempts to relax and explore Gracklstugh
    * Ebadius rents a room and eavesdrops on nearby rooms
    * Shuushar begins to explore the city, and Alias discovers him in an argument with a duergar merchant and sends him to the inn
    * Groggle chats with some deep gnomes
    * Dad informs Groggle that he is leaving and begins looking for an orphanage
    * Sarith rents a room and crashes with Shuushar
* Alias and Dad witness a duergar being stabbed by mysterious duergar and bring the man back to the inn
* Groggle heals the man and Ebadius escorts him out of the Darklake District, introducing himself as Werz
* **The session ends with the party gearing for the next day, and Ebadius plans to meet Werz at the Shattered Spire**

## Trivia
* Alias, when performing perception checks, would either perform amazingly or horribly, never inbetween.
* After arriving in Gracklstugh, not a single player asked someone if they knew of a way out of the underdark.
