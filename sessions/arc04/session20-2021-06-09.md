[Home](../../README.md) > [Sessions](../info.md) > [Arc 4](info.md) > Session 20

* [Ebadius](../../characters/pcs/ebadius.md) scouts ahead at the Shattered Spire to check for anything suspicous and finds nothing
* [Groggle](../../characters/pcs/groggle.md) asks about returning to the surface and gets mediocre answers
* The party hears noises from outside and discovers a stone giant with two heads
* [Alias](../../characters/pcs/alias.md), [Dad](../../characters/pcs/dad.md), Ebadius, Groggle, [Eldeth](../../characters/party/eldeth.md), and [Ront](../../characters/party/ront.md) engage the giant in combat
    * The giant nearly one-shot Groggle
    * Dad misses nearly every attack
    * Eldeth does significant damage with melee
    * Ebadius protected Groggle after his near-death experience
    * Ront is nearly crushed to death
    * Two guards arrive to assist in the fight
* The party divulges their identities to the guards, except Ebadius who says his name is Teldin
* Ront returns to the inn while the party heals the injured
* The party returns to the inn and discusses their next move
* Ront has a strange mental moment
* Alias informs [Sarith](../../characters/party/sarith.md) of what happened while [Shuushar](../../characters/party/shuushar.md) sleeps
* **The session ends with the party prepping for sleep and the next day**

## Trivia
* This session saw extreme trouble from the players as only a few of the characters speak common languages with the city's inhabitants.
* Dad rolled terribly in combat, but was one of the few people to leave the battle unscathed. In fact, Dad's major accomplishment of the day was not in combat, but in calming Ront down.
* When discussing who could help the next day, someone mentioned "Shuushar will say how he can help, then Sarith will actually help."
