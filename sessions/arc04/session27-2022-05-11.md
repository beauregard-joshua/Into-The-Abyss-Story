* Alias gets Dad's help to tie Droki up
* Droki returns to normal size and is ripped apart by the rope
* Groggle heals Droki and Droki passes out
* **The session ends with the party deciding what to do with Droki and where to go next**

## Trivia
* Ebadius had reached near death before being stablized, with two successful and two unsuccessful saving throws.
* With Ebadius near death for most of the session, the party made a note that they could make more moral decisions without him getting in the way. This came back to bite them, however, when they considered leaving the Whorlstone Tunnels, but Ebadius was the one that had memorized the route.
