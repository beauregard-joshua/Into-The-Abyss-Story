# Session 29: Viles and Smiles (2023-09-26)

[Home](../../README.md) > [Sessions](../info.md) > [Arc 4](info.md) > Session 29

* The party opposes the encountered grey dwarves and attempts diplomacy
    * [Alias](../../characters/pcs/alias.md) attempts to converse with Lorthio through a language barrier
    * [Ebadius](../../characters/pcs/ebadius.md) aggravates Lorthio with threats
    * [Groggle](../../characters/pcs/groggle.md) casts *suggestion* on Ebadius twice to convince him to calm down
    * [Dad](../../characters/pcs/dad.md) attempts to communicate to the subordinate dwarves through gesturing
* Groggle successfully casts *suggestion* on Ebadius and causes him to become diplomatic after being struck with alchemist's fire
* Alias attempts to disuade Lorthio from attacking, but eventually attacks him herself
* Groggle casts *minor illusion* to mimic a fire, convincing everyone to leave
* Ebadius follows the sound looking for people
* Alias injures Ebadius to knock him out of his trance
* Ebadius casts *invisibility* and leaves, while Alias tries to find him with chalk
* **The session ends with Ebadius leaving the group while invisibile**

## Trivia
* Ebadius took substantial damage from alchemist's fire, but was never freed from *suggestion*. This was due to a technicality, as the spell is only broken when the target is damaged by the caster or their allies, but Ebadius was only injured by Lorthio, who was neither of these.
* Dad successfully performed a backflip to stagger the grey dwarves. This marks the first time that Dad performed a backflip to break combat.
