## Trivia
* Alias took two swings at Ebadius during their interaction with Gartokkar, and missed both times
* When Dad stepped in to speak with Themberchaud, Dad acually snuck up on him, and Themberchaud roared in response.
* When speaking with Themberchaud, Dad asked him what he would do if they all wound up dead, and his answer was to the tune of "he wouldn't care." Dad took this to mean that if they one day choose to abandon Gracklstugh that Themberchaud will do nothing to stop them.
