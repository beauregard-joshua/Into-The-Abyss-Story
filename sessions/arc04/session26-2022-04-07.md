[Home](../../README.md) > [Sessions](../info.md) > [Arc 4](info.md) > Session 26

* [Ebadius](../../characters/pcs/ebadius.md) brings Droki back to the party outside Themberchaud's Lair
* Ebadius translates between the party and Droki regarding what to do with him
    * [Alias](../../characters/pcs/alias.md) searches Droki with Ebadius and finds a few magical objects and deliverables
    * Droki admits to needing to deliver objects to the Gray Ghosts and "the chanters"
    * [Eldeth](../../characters/party/eldeth.md) suggests delivering Droki to Gartokkar and Themberchaud
* Alias, [Dad](../../party/pcs/dad.md), Ebadius, Groggle, and Eldeth agree to follow Droki into the Whorlstone Tunnels to meet with the Gray Ghosts
* [Groggle](../../party/pcs/groggle.md) nearly gets his eye stabbed by a knife on the way
* Droki eats a mushroom that shrinks him and escapes through a crack in the wall
    * Ebadius wades through a pool of water and Groggle chases after Droki through the crack in the wall
    * Ebadius and Groggle encounter a swarm of insects and Ebadius is knocked unconscious
    * Alias, Dad, and Eldeth maneuver through the cracks in the wall.
* **The session ends with Groggle running through the fungi to get away from the swarming insects.**

## Trivia
* When Droki mentioned that he was carrying "a black lump of heavy metal", Dad began singing *Back in Black* by *AC/DC*.
* Ebadius carried Groggle into the fungus thicket where they encountered the swarming insects. When they saw the insects, Groggle repsonded by saying "go back" until Ebadius eventually dropped.
