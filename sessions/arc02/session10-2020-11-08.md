* [Groggle](../../characters/pcs/groggle.md) buys supplies in the morning
* [Sarith](../../characters/party/sarith.md) takes money from Groggle and purchases a few supplies
* The party begins to infiltrate the cult of the Deep Father
    * [Alias](../../characters/pcs/alias.md) backs away and encircles the altar of the Deep Father from behind
    * The remainder of the party moves into the altar of the Deep Father
    * [Ebadius](../../characters/pcs/ebadius.md) fires a *scorching ray* at a kuo-toa and starts a fight, with Ploopploopeen killing Bloppblippodd
    * Alias distracts many of the kuo-toa
    * The party struggles to fight a lot of the kuo-toa without knowing which side anyone is on
* Demogorgon emerges from the Darklake during the ritual
    * [Dad](../../characters/pcs/dad.md), [Stool](../../characters/party/stool.md), Sarith, [Eldeth](../../characters/party/eldeth.md), and [Ront](../../characters/party/ront.md) descend into madness from the shear sight of Demogorgon
    * Alias and Ebadius release the prisoner chained to the altar
* The party escapes Sloobludop
    * Sarith escapes with the sacrifice from the altar
    * Dad and Eldeth escape together, and meet up with Sarith and the prisoner
    * [Shuushar](../../characters/party/shuushar.md) and Ront meet up with the others
    * Ebadius and Groggle meet up with the group
    * Alias finally arrives
    * Stool and [Buppido](../../characters/party/buppido.md) escape independently and are not found
* The prisoner introduces himself as [Hemeth](../../characters/party/hemeth.md) and is from Gracklstugh
* **The session ends with the party making a plan to head to Gracklstugh, heading for Neverlight Grove**

## Trivia
* Ebadius is able to identify Demogorgon when he emerges. This is because of his demon heritage, and it's revealed that he is related to the demon lord Graz'zt.
* Dad made it clear that while he thinks its sad that Stool disappeared, losing Buppido was likely for the best, since he was always in everyone's way.
