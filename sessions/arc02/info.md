# Arc 2: Travel to Sloobludop

After escaping the prison at Velkenvelve, the party finds themselves
at the mercy of the environment of the Underdark. With no supplies
and only a few options, the party decides to travel to the nearest
city without drow, the kuo-toan city of Sloobludop. They are led by
their companion Shuushar, traveling the darkness and dealing with
horrors along the way. They find their way to Sloobludop where they
stumble upon a schism between the altar of the Sea Mother and the
cult of the Deep Father.
