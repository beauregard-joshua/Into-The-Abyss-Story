# Session 5: An Accidental Genocide (2020-07-26)
* [Groggle](../../characters/pcs/groggle.md), [Ebadius](../../characters/pcs/ebadius.md), and [Shuushar](../../characters/party/shuushar.md) leave the spooky palace and everyone rejoins at the exit
* Party encounters 4 goblins
    * Party attempts to sneak past them, but [Jimjar](../../characters/party/jimjar.md) makes too much noise and wakes them up
    * Several members kill 3 goblins and release the last one, feeling a little ashamed
* On watch, [Alias](../../characters/pcs/alias.md) and [Eldeth](../../characters/party/eldeth.md) hear noises from the tunnel
* **Session ended abruptly due to Roll20 going down**

## Trivia
* Several party members, such as Groggle and [Sarith](../../characters/party/sarith.md), only wanted to pass through safely, while other members, such as [Ront](../../characters/party/ront.md) and Jimjar, wanted to kill the goblins. It is believed that Alias had not qualms with killing the goblins save for the fact that he was trying to court Eldeth and this made him look bad.
* This session was played on Mark's birthday, and Nick brought a cupcake for it.
