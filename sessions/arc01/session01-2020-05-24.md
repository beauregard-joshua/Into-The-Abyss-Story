## Trivia
* Dad successfully does several backflips to attack the drow. This establishes some random acrobatic skill that Dad tries to do regularly.
* Buppido acts strangely before his head is thrown to the wall. From here on out the party suspects that Buppido is not trustworthy.
* After Groggle pacifies the lower spider, he doesn't have a plan.
