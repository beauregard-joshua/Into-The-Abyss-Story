## Trivia
* After Sarith throws the rock and starts screaming, Dad yells "Anarchy!", which spurs Eldeth into action as well.
* While Derendil was in the adventure for only a brief amount of time, the party has exressed sorrow for his demise, since he was one of the major players in the battle that saved everyone else
